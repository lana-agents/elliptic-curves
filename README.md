# Elliptic curves

A [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) formalisation project on the arithmetic
of elliptic curves, built on top of [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

## Scope

The aim of this repository is to formalise results about the reduction theory of
elliptic curves over local and global fields, following Silverman's
*The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves* (GTM 106). The project builds on Mathlib's
existing theory of Weierstrass and elliptic curves
(`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.*`).

Planned developments include:

* **Semi-stable reduction** of elliptic curves.
* The **Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion**: an elliptic curve has good reduction
  if and only if its Tate module is unramified.

## Layout

```
EllipticCurves.lean          -- root module, imports the whole library
EllipticCurves/
└── Basic.lean               -- project entry point; re-exports Mathlib foundations
```

New files should be added under `EllipticCurves/` and imported from the root
`EllipticCurves.lean` module (kept in sync with `lake exe mk_all`).

## Building

This project pins a specific Mathlib revision via `lake-manifest.json` and the
matching toolchain in `lean-toolchain`. To build:

```bash
lake exe cache get   # download the Mathlib build cache
lake build
```

## Linting

Two different linter suites apply to this project, and they are easy to confuse.

* The **syntactic** linters run during elaboration and surface as build warnings.
  They are enabled by `weak.linter.mathlibStandardSet = true` in `lakefile.toml`,
  and `lake build --wfail` (see below) is what enforces them.
* The **environment** linters — `simpNF`, `unusedArguments`, `defsWithUnderscore`,
  `docBlame`, `synTaut`, `checkType`, `deprecatedNoSince`, `impossibleInstance`,
  `nonClassInstance`, `simpComm`, `structureInType`, `subsetDotNotationLinter`,
  `tacticDocs`, `unusedHavesSuffices` — are a **post-hoc pass over the elaborated
  environment**, run by Batteries' `runLinter` driver. `lake build` never invokes
  them, so a green, warning-free build says nothing at all about them.

Run the second suite with:

```bash
lake lint            # auto-detects the default target, `EllipticCurves`
```

It takes about 17 s on top of a warm build (measured; also 15 s on a CI runner),
and prints `-- Linting passed for EllipticCurves.` when clean.

CI runs it on every push and pull request: `leanprover/lean-action@v1` probes for a
lint driver and runs `lake lint` itself when it finds one. **The driver is the single
line `lintDriver = "batteries/runLinter"` in `lakefile.toml`** — remove it and both
`lake lint` and the CI gate silently become no-ops, with no error and no warning.

That silence is not hypothetical: the suite had never been run on this repository at
all, and when it first was, it reported 53 findings — 33 `@[simp]` lemmas whose
left-hand side was not in simp-normal form (so they could never fire), 16 naming
violations and 4 unused hypotheses — against a build that was, and had always been,
warning-free.

## Development

The `.orchestra/` folder contains scripts used to prepare and validate the
project in an automated setting:

* `before.sh` warms the Mathlib build cache.
* `validation.sh` checks that the worktree is clean, that every `.lean` file is
  imported (`mk_all --check`), and that the project builds with warnings treated
  as errors (`lake build --wfail`).
