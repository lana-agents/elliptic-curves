# Elliptic curves

A [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) formalisation project on the arithmetic
of elliptic curves, built on top of [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

## Scope

The aim of this repository is to formalise results about the reduction theory of
elliptic curves over local and global fields, following Silverman's
*The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves* (GTM 106). The project builds on Mathlib's
existing theory of Weierstrass and elliptic curves
(`Mathlib.AlgebraicGeometry.EllipticCurve.*`).

The two headline targets are:

* **Semi-stable reduction** of elliptic curves.
* The **Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion**: an elliptic curve has good reduction
  if and only if its Tate module is unramified.

Neither is finished, and neither is untouched. The *good ⇒ unramified* direction of
Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich is proved, in the form stated for an abstract complete DVR
(`Reduction/NeronOggShafarevich.lean`); the converse, and the classical local-field
packaging in which inertia is realised inside `Gal(Kᵘʳ/K)`, are open. For semi-stable
reduction, the reduction-type trichotomy, the `j`-invariant criteria and the
potential-good / potential-multiplicative dichotomy are in place (`Reduction/`), but
the theorem itself is not yet assembled.

### What is formalised

The following are developed here, each in the directory named. This list is a
description of the tree, not a completeness claim: most of these are established
under hypotheses that are stated in the relevant module docstrings, and several
hold at small or restricted indices rather than in general.

* **Reduction over a discrete valuation ring** (`Reduction/`) — the reduction map on
  points and its additivity, the kernel of reduction `E₁(K)` and its identification
  with the formal group `Ê(𝔪)`, injectivity on prime-to-`p` torsion, the reduction-type
  trichotomy and the `j`-invariant criteria, base change to a DVR extension, and the
  good ⇒ unramified direction of Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich.
* **The function field `F(W)`, its places and its divisors** (`FunctionField/`) — the
  affine coordinate ring and its normality, divisors and orders of vanishing, the
  degree-zero theorem and the class group, the places of the projective curve, and the
  multiplication-by-`n` and translation-by-a-point pullbacks.
* **The Weil pairing** `eₙ : E[n] × E[n] → μₙ` (`FunctionField/WeilPairing*.lean`) —
  the divisor-theoretic engine that extracts an `n`-th root of a function from an
  `n`-divisible divisor is stated at a general `n` (`NthRootOfPullback.lean`), but the
  root `g_S` it is applied to is constructed at `n = 2` and `n = 3` only, and so is
  everything downstream of it: the pairing as a function of two torsion points, its
  bilinearity, antisymmetry, the alternating property, non-degeneracy, perfectness,
  Galois equivariance and the identification of `det ρ_{E,n}` with the cyclotomic
  character `χₙ`.
* **The Weierstrass formal group** (`FormalGroup/`) — the coordinate series `x(z)`,
  `y(z)`, the formal group law `F_E` as a genuine bivariate power series with its
  commutativity and associativity, the formal logarithm and exponential, the
  multiplication-by-`n` series, and the group `Ê(𝔪)` over a complete local ring.
* **`n`-torsion and division polynomials** (`Torsion/`, `DivisionPolynomial/`) — `E[n]`,
  the duplication and tripling coordinate formulas, surjectivity of `[2]` and `[3]`,
  and the structure theorem `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²`, currently proved for every `3`-smooth `n`
  over an algebraically closed field of characteristic other than `2` and `3`.
* **The Tate module and its Galois representation** (`TateModule/`) — `T_ℓE = lim_k E[ℓᵏ]`,
  the matrix form `ρ_ℓ : G → GL₂(ℤ_ℓ)` of the ℓ-adic representation, its continuity, and
  the profiniteness of its image. `T_ℓE ≅ ℤ_ℓ²` is unconditional at `ℓ = 2` and `ℓ = 3`,
  and at a general `ℓ` it is reduced to a coherent system of generating pairs for the
  `E[ℓᵏ]` (`TateModule/PrimaryFree.lean`).
* Supporting Galois-theoretic material (`Galois/`) and the Newton-polygon dichotomy for a
  Weierstrass equation (`NewtonPolygon.lean`), which is consumed by both `Reduction/` and
  `FunctionField/`.

## Layout

Measured at commit `d5951f8`; the counts drift, the structure does not.

```
EllipticCurves.lean          -- root module, imports the whole library
EllipticCurves/
├── Basic.lean               -- project entry point; re-exports Mathlib foundations
├── NewtonPolygon.lean       -- the slope-3/2 dichotomy at a pole of a Weierstrass equation
├── DivisionPolynomial/      --   1 file   coprimality of the division polynomials
├── FormalGroup/             --  57 files  the Weierstrass formal group law and Ê(𝔪)
├── FunctionField/           -- 167 files  F(W), its places and divisors; the Weil pairing
├── Galois/                  --   3 files  cyclotomic character, unramified Galois modules
├── Reduction/               --  65 files  reduction over a DVR; reduction types; NOS
├── TateModule/              --  36 files  T_ℓE and the ℓ-adic representation ρ_ℓ
└── Torsion/                 --  29 files  E[n] and the torsion structure theorem
```

360 `.lean` files in total. `FunctionField/` is flat rather than nested; within it the
file-name prefixes `MulByTwo`/`MulByThree`/`MulByN`, `Translation`, `Place`, `Divisor` and
`WeilPairing` are what group the material.

New files should be added under `EllipticCurves/` and imported from the root
`EllipticCurves.lean` module (kept in sync with `lake exe mk_all`).

## Building

This project pins a specific Mathlib revision via `lake-manifest.json` and the
matching toolchain in `lean-toolchain`. To build:

```bash
lake exe cache get   # download the Mathlib build cache
lake build
```

## Linting

Two different linter suites apply to this project, and they are easy to confuse.

* The **syntactic** linters run during elaboration and surface as build warnings.
  They are enabled by `weak.linter.mathlibStandardSet = true` in `lakefile.toml`,
  and `lake build --wfail` (see below) is what enforces them.
* The **environment** linters — `simpNF`, `unusedArguments`, `defsWithUnderscore`,
  `docBlame`, `synTaut`, `checkType`, `deprecatedNoSince`, `impossibleInstance`,
  `nonClassInstance`, `simpComm`, `structureInType`, `subsetDotNotationLinter`,
  `tacticDocs`, `unusedHavesSuffices` — are a **post-hoc pass over the elaborated
  environment**, run by Batteries' `runLinter` driver. `lake build` never invokes
  them, so a green, warning-free build says nothing at all about them.

Run the second suite with:

```bash
lake lint            # auto-detects the default target, `EllipticCurves`
```

It takes roughly 10–20 s on top of a warm build (measured: ~11 s locally, 15–18 s on a
CI runner), and prints `-- Linting passed for EllipticCurves.` when clean.

CI runs it on every push and pull request: `leanprover/lean-action@v1` probes with
`lake check-lint` and runs `lake lint` itself when it finds a driver. **The driver is the
single line `lintDriver = "batteries/runLinter"` in `lakefile.toml`**, and it is
load-bearing. Remove it and the two halves behave very differently:

* `lake lint` **fails loudly** — `error: no lint driver configured and builtin linting
  is disabled`, exit 1. Locally you cannot miss it.
* CI, under `lean-action`'s default `lint: default`, would **not**: the probe fails, the
  action logs `lake check-lint failed -> will not run lake lint`, and the job stays green
  with the suite never run. That is the silent failure mode, and it is why the workflow
  passes `lint: "true"` explicitly — that setting turns a missing driver into
  `::error::lake check-lint failed: could not find a lint driver` and a red job, rather
  than a skipped step.

That silence is not hypothetical: the suite had never been run on this repository at
all, and when it first was, it reported 53 findings — 33 `@[simp]` lemmas whose
left-hand side was not in simp-normal form (so they could never fire), 16 naming
violations and 4 unused hypotheses — against a build that was, and had always been,
warning-free.

## Development

The `.orchestra/` folder contains scripts used to prepare and validate the
project in an automated setting:

* `before.sh` warms the Mathlib build cache.
* `validation.sh` checks that the worktree is clean, that every `.lean` file is
  imported (`mk_all --check`), that the project builds with warnings treated as
  errors (`lake build --wfail`), and that the environment linters pass
  (`lake lint`; see [Linting](#linting) — the last two are different suites).
