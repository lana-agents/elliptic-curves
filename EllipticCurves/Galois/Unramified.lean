# Unramified Galois modules

This file introduces the representation-theoretic vocabulary needed to state the
Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion (issue #73): the notion of a Galois module being
*unramified*, meaning that a distinguished *inertia* subgroup acts trivially.

We work with a group `G` (thought of as a Galois group `Gal(K̄/K)` or `Gal(L/K)`)
together with a subgroup `I ≤ G` (the inertia subgroup) and a `G`-action on some
type `M` (the Galois module).

## Main definitions

* `IsUnramified I M` : the subgroup `I` acts trivially on `M`, i.e. every `σ ∈ I`
  fixes every element of `M`.

## Main results

* `isUnramified_iff_fixedPoints_eq_univ`, `IsUnramified.mem_fixedPoints` : the
  relation with the set of fixed points `M ^ I`.
* `IsUnramified.of_injective`, `IsUnramified.of_surjective` : `IsUnramified` is
  inherited by `G`-equivariant sub-objects and quotients.
* `IsUnramified.prod`, `IsUnramified.pi` : `IsUnramified` is preserved by
  (finite) products.
* `IsUnramified.mono`, `isUnramified_bot` : monotonicity in the inertia subgroup,
  and the trivial inertia subgroup gives no ramification.
* `ValuationSubring.IsUnramifiedAt` : the special case where `I` is the inertia
  subgroup `ValuationSubring.inertiaSubgroup` of a valuation subring, which is the
  situation for the ℓ-adic Tate module of an elliptic curve.

/-- A type `M` carrying a `G`-action is **unramified** with respect to the subgroup
`I ≤ G` (thought of as an inertia subgroup) if `I` acts trivially on `M`, i.e. every
`σ ∈ I` fixes every element of `M`.

This is the module-theoretic input to the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion: an elliptic
curve has good reduction exactly when its Tate module is unramified in this sense. -/

This is the shape in which the notion is applied to elliptic curves: `M` is the

of the equivalent conditions in the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion. -/
