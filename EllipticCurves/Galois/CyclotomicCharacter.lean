# The cyclotomic character of `Gal(F/S)`

Let `F / S` be a field extension and `G = F ≃ₐ[S] F` its group of `S`-algebra automorphisms. Every
`σ ∈ G` permutes the `n`-th roots of unity of `F`, and since `μ_n(F)` is cyclic that permutation is
`ζ ↦ ζ ^ j` for an integer `j = j(σ)` well defined modulo `n`. The resulting homomorphisms

* `galoisModularCyclotomicChar S F hn : G →* (ZMod n)ˣ`  (`χ_n`, one `n` at a time), and
* `galoisCyclotomicChar S F p : G →* ℤ_[p]ˣ`  (`χ_p`, the `p`-adic character assembling the levels
  `n = p ^ k`)

are the **cyclotomic characters** of `F / S`. Both are Mathlib's `modularCyclotomicCharacter` and
`cyclotomicCharacter`, which are stated for `RingAut F`, restricted along the tautological action of
`G` on `F`; this file is the restriction, its specification, and the two facts about it that the
rest of the development needs.

## Why this file exists

`EllipticCurves.TateModule.Determinant` defines the determinant character of the `2`-adic Galois
representation,

`galoisDetTwo : (F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* ℤ_[2]ˣ`,

and its docstring — together with those of `EllipticCurves.TateModule.Image`,
`EllipticCurves.TateModule.ImageProfinite`, `EllipticCurves.TateModule.MatrixContinuity`,
`EllipticCurves.TateModule.MatrixRep` and `EllipticCurves.TateModule.Profinite` — names the
identification of that character with the cyclotomic character as the goal the Weil-pairing work is
for. Until now that identification could not even be *written down*, since no cyclotomic character
existed in this development.

With `galoisCyclotomicChar S F 2 : (F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* ℤ_[2]ˣ` the two characters have the same type, so

```
galoisDetTwo = galoisCyclotomicChar S F 2
```

is a well-formed proposition. It is **not proved here**, and nothing in this file brings it closer
to being proved: it needs the Weil pairing on `E[2 ^ k]` — the rung-5 divisor identity
`div g_S = [n]∗(S)` (`#418`, gated on `#421`/`#422`), bilinearity in the divisor slot, the
alternating property (`#465` deliverable 2), and non-degeneracy (Ward-gated, `#242`). What this
file supplies is the right-hand side, and the translation of the Weil-pairing equivariance into the
form that computation consumes (`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingCyclotomic`).

## The specification

Both characters are pinned down by how they act on roots of unity:

* `galoisModularCyclotomicChar_spec` : `σ t = t ^ (χ_n σ).val` for every `t ∈ μ_n(F)`;
* `galoisCyclotomicChar_spec` : `σ t = t ^ ((χ_p σ).val.toZModPow k).val` for every `t` with
  `t ^ p ^ k = 1`;

and `galoisModularCyclotomicChar_unique` says the first property determines `χ_n σ`.

`galoisCyclotomicChar_toZModPow` is the compatibility between the two: the `p ^ k`-th level of
`χ_p` is `χ_{p ^ k}`. This is what makes `χ_p` a character *of the inverse system* `μ_{p^k}(F)`, and
therefore the right object to compare with `det ρ_{E,p}`, which is defined through the same inverse
system.

## Hypotheses, and that they are met

`χ_n` needs `hn : Nat.card μ_n(F) = n` — that `F` really contains `n` `n`-th roots of unity — and
the specification of `χ_p` needs `HasEnoughRootsOfUnity F (p ^ i)` for every `i`. Both hold in the
setting the Tate module is built over: `galoisModularCyclotomicChar_hypothesis_of_isSepClosed` and
`hasEnoughRootsOfUnity_pow_of_isSepClosed` record that a separably closed `F` with `(p : F) ≠ 0`
supplies both — the second because Mathlib already makes it an instance, so typeclass search finds
it and a consumer discharges nothing by hand.

## Main definitions

* `galoisRingAut` : the tautological `(F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* RingAut F`.
* `galoisModularCyclotomicChar` : `χ_n : (F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* (ZMod n)ˣ`.
* `galoisCyclotomicChar` : `χ_p : (F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* ℤ_[p]ˣ`.

## Main statements

* `galoisModularCyclotomicChar_spec`, `galoisModularCyclotomicChar_unique`.
* `restrictRootsOfUnity_eq_pow_galoisModularCyclotomicChar` : the Galois action on `μ_n(F)` *is*
  raising to the power `χ_n(σ)`. This is the bridge to the Weil-pairing equivariance statements,
  which are phrased through `restrictRootsOfUnity`.
* `galoisModularCyclotomicChar_eq_one_iff` : `χ_n σ = 1` if and only if `σ` fixes every `n`-th root
  of unity — the character is a genuine invariant of `σ`, not bookkeeping.
* `galoisCyclotomicChar_spec`, `galoisCyclotomicChar_toZModPow`.
* `galoisCyclotomicChar_continuous` : `χ_p` is continuous for the Krull topology on `F ≃ₐ[S] F`.

/-! ### The tautological action of `Gal(F/S)` on `F` -/

/-- **The tautological homomorphism `Gal(F/S) →* RingAut F`.** An `S`-algebra automorphism of `F`
is in particular a ring automorphism, multiplicatively in `σ`.

Mathlib's cyclotomic characters are homomorphisms out of `RingAut F = F ≃+* F`; composing with this
map is what turns them into characters of `F ≃ₐ[S] F`. It is definitionally the identity on the
underlying function (`galoisRingAut_apply`), so every Mathlib lemma about
`modularCyclotomicCharacter` or `cyclotomicCharacter` applies at `galoisRingAut S F σ` with no
bridging rewrite.

Marked `noncomputable`: the definition is computable, but compiling it costs about seventy seconds
of build time for code no one runs. -/

/-! ### The modular cyclotomic character `χ_n` -/

/-- **The mod-`n` cyclotomic character** `χ_n : Gal(F/S) →* (ℤ/nℤ)ˣ`, characterised by
`σ ζ = ζ ^ χ_n(σ)` for every `n`-th root of unity `ζ` of `F`.

The hypothesis `hn` says that `F` contains exactly `n` `n`-th roots of unity, so that the exponent
is well defined modulo `n` rather than modulo the size of `μ_n(F)`. -/

/-- **The Galois action on `μ_n(F)` is raising to the power `χ_n(σ)`.**

`restrictRootsOfUnity` is how the Galois action on the value group of the Weil pairing is spelled in
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingGaloisMu` and
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingGaloisDivisor`; this identifies it with an explicit power.
It is the step that turns "`e_n` is Galois-equivariant" into the classical
`e_n(σS, σT) = e_n(S, T) ^ χ_n(σ)` (Silverman AEC III.8.1(e)), carried out in
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingCyclotomic`. -/

/-! ### The character is trivial exactly on the elements acting trivially -/

/-- Raising an `n`-th root of unity to the power `(1 : ZMod n).val` does nothing.

Not a `simp` triviality: `(1 : ZMod n).val` is `1` only when `1 < n`, and is `0` at `n = 1`. The
degenerate case works because `μ_1(F)` is trivial, so `t = 1` there. -/

/-- **`χ_n(σ) = 1` if and only if `σ` fixes every `n`-th root of unity.**

The character is therefore a genuine invariant of `σ`, and not bookkeeping that could be trivial for
every `σ` — it detects exactly the elements of `Gal(F/S)` acting trivially on `μ_n(F)`. This holds
for every extension `F / S` and every `n`, so no concrete field is needed to see it. -/

/-! ### The `p`-adic cyclotomic character `χ_p` -/

/-- **The `p`-adic cyclotomic character** `χ_p : Gal(F/S) →* ℤ_[p]ˣ`, assembling the mod-`p ^ k`
characters over all `k` (`galoisCyclotomicChar_toZModPow`).

This is the character `det ρ_{E,p}` is expected to equal: `galoisDetTwo` of
`EllipticCurves.TateModule.Determinant` has type `(F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* ℤ_[2]ˣ`, exactly the type of
`galoisCyclotomicChar S F 2`. As Mathlib defines it, `χ_p` is the trivial character when `F` fails
to contain enough roots of unity, so the statements below carry
`[∀ i, HasEnoughRootsOfUnity F (p ^ i)]`. -/
noncomputable def galoisCyclotomicChar (S F : Type*) [Field S] [Field F] [Algebra S F]
    (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] : (F ≃ₐ[S] F) →* ℤ_[p]ˣ :=
  (cyclotomicCharacter F p).comp (galoisRingAut S F)

/-- **The defining property of `χ_p`:** modulo `p ^ k`, it raises `p ^ k`-th roots of unity to their
`σ`-images. -/

    σ t = t ^ ((galoisCyclotomicChar S F p σ).val.toZModPow k).val :=
  cyclotomicCharacter.spec p (galoisRingAut S F σ) t ht

/-- **`χ_p` refines to `χ_{p ^ k}` at every level.** This is the compatibility that makes `χ_p` a
character of the inverse system `μ_{p ^ k}(F)`, hence the right object to compare with the
determinant of the `p`-adic representation, which is built from the same system. -/
theorem galoisCyclotomicChar_toZModPow (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime]
    [∀ i, HasEnoughRootsOfUnity F (p ^ i)] (σ : F ≃ₐ[S] F) (k : ℕ) :

          (HasEnoughRootsOfUnity.natCard_rootsOfUnity F (p ^ k)) σ).val :=
  cyclotomicCharacter.toZModPow p (galoisRingAut S F σ)

/-- **`χ_p` is continuous** for the Krull topology on `Gal(F/S)` and the `p`-adic topology on
`ℤ_[p]ˣ`.

Recorded here because the target `det ρ_{E,2} = χ_2` should be an equality of *continuous*
characters: the continuity of `ρ_{E,2}` is itself a theorem of this development
(`EllipticCurves.TateModule.Continuity`, `EllipticCurves.TateModule.MatrixContinuity`), and it would
be odd to compare it with a character not known to be continuous. Unlike the statements above this
needs no roots-of-unity hypothesis — in the degenerate case `χ_p` is constant. -/
theorem galoisCyclotomicChar_continuous (p : ℕ) [Fact p.Prime] :
    Continuous (galoisCyclotomicChar S F p) :=
  cyclotomicCharacter.continuous p S F

/-! ### The hypotheses are met in the setting of the Tate module -/

/-- Over a separably closed field of characteristic not dividing `p`, every `p ^ i` has its full
complement of roots of unity. This is the standing setting of `EllipticCurves.TateModule`, so the
`[∀ i, HasEnoughRootsOfUnity F (p ^ i)]` hypothesis above is not a burden on the consumer.

Recorded as a theorem rather than an instance: `IsSepClosed.hasEnoughRootsOfUnity_pow` already
supplies it to typeclass search, and a second copy would only add a redundant node. The point of
stating it is that the fact be greppable from this file. -/
