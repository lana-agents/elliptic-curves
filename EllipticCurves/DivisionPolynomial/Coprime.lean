# Coprimality of division polynomials: `(Φ₂, Ψ₂Sq)`, `(Ψ₃, Ψ₂Sq)`, `(Φ₃, ΨSq₃)`, general `n`

For a Weierstrass curve `W` over a commutative ring, the division polynomials

```
Ψ₂Sq = 4X³ + b₂X² + 2b₄X + b₆,     Ψ₃ = 3X⁴ + b₂X³ + 3b₄X² + 3b₆X + b₈,
Φ₂   = X⁴ − b₄X² − 2b₆X − b₈ = X·Ψ₂Sq − Ψ₃
```

satisfy an explicit Bézout identity with right-hand side `Δ²`:

```lean
bezout_Φ_two_Ψ₂Sq : W.bezoutΦTwo * W.Φ 2 + W.bezoutΨ₂Sq * W.Ψ₂Sq = C (W.Δ ^ 2)
```

Hence when `Δ` is a unit — in particular for `[W.IsElliptic]` — the pairs `(Φ₂, Ψ₂Sq)` and
`(Ψ₃, Ψ₂Sq)` are **coprime**.

Geometrically the second statement says that no point of `W` is both `2`-torsion and `3`-torsion,
which is exactly what fails on a singular curve; and indeed the identity is *false* without `Δ`, so
the discriminant is genuinely load-bearing rather than decorative.

The pair `(Φ₃, ΨSq₃)` is here too, and it is **not** obtained the same way — see the section on the
`n = 3` certificate below.

## Why an explicit certificate rather than a root argument

The classical proof is "a common root would be a point that is both `2`- and `3`-torsion, hence
`O`, which is not affine". That argument needs the torsion characterisation
`n • P = O ↔ Ψₙ(x P) = 0`, which is a substantial separate development. The Bézout certificate
needs none of it, works over an arbitrary commutative ring, and is checked by `ring1`.

Mathlib has no coprimality statement anywhere under
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/` (checked against `v4.32.0`), so
everything here is new; it is an upstream candidate, since nothing
below mentions function fields, places or divisors.  ⚠️ That is now truest of the general-`n`
reduction, which uses only Mathlib's own `Φ` and `ΨSq` and holds over an arbitrary commutative
ring: it is the piece of this file with no hypothesis to negotiate.

## Where the certificate comes from, and the one subtlety

`bezoutΦTwo` and `bezoutΨ₂Sq` are the cofactors produced by the adjugate of the Sylvester matrix of
the pair, so the identity they satisfy in the **free** polynomial ring `ℤ[b₂, b₄, b₆, b₈][X]` has
right-hand side the resultant

```
Res(Ψ₂Sq, Φ₂) = b₂⁴b₈² − 6b₂³b₄b₆b₈ + … − 256b₈³
```

which is **not** `Δ²` there — `b₂, b₄, b₆, b₈` are not independent. The two differ by an explicit
multiple of `4b₈ − b₂b₆ + b₄²`, which vanishes by Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.b_relation`. That is
why the proof below is a `linear_combination` against `b_relation` rather than a bare `ring1`: the
identity is true for Weierstrass curves and false for free `b`-parameters.

Because the relation is used in the form `4b₈ = b₂b₆ − b₄²` and never divided by, **nothing here
needs `2` or `3` to be invertible**; the results hold in every characteristic.

## The `n = 3` certificate is a congruence, not a resultant

A Bézout identity for `(Φ₃, ΨSq₃)` itself is not viable: `deg Φ₃ = 9` and `deg ΨSq₃ = 8`, so the
Sylvester matrix is `17 × 17` and its adjugate cofactors are polynomials no `ring1` call would
survive. What replaces it, in `preΨ₄_sq_eq_Ψ₂Sq_pow_add_Ψ₃_mul`, is the congruence

```
preΨ₄² ≡ Ψ₂Sq⁴   (mod Ψ₃),
```

which is `ψ₂(2P) = ψ₄(P)/ψ₂(P)⁴` read univariately and then reduced by `Φ₂ = X·Ψ₂Sq − Ψ₃`; its
cofactor is a five-term expression in `X`, `Ψ₂Sq` and `Ψ₃`. From it, `isCoprime_Ψ₃_Ψ₂Sq` alone
gives `IsCoprime preΨ₄ Ψ₃`, and `Φ₃ = X·Ψ₃² − preΨ₄·Ψ₂Sq` with `ΨSq₃ = Ψ₃²` finishes.

So the discriminant still does all the work at `n = 3`, but only through the `n = 2` certificate:
**no new Bézout identity is computed**, and the two `Δ²`-certificates above remain the only ones in
this file.

## ⚠️ At general `n`, `Φ` is not the difficulty — and this file now says so with a theorem

Mathlib *defines* `Φₙ = X · ΨSqₙ − preΨₙ₊₁ · preΨₙ₋₁ · Eₙ`, where `Eₙ` is `1` for even `n` and
`Ψ₂Sq` for odd `n`.  Two consequences, both unconditional in `n` and in the ring:

* modulo `ΨSqₙ`, `Φₙ` **is** the adjacent product `−preΨₙ₊₁ · preΨₙ₋₁ · Eₙ`
  (`Φ_eq_neg_adjacent_add`);
* the square of that product is `ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁` (`ΨSq_succ_mul_ΨSq_pred`) — because `n + 1` and
  `n - 1` have the same parity, so the two `if`s in `ΨSq` contribute `Eₙ²` between them.

Together they give `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent`:

```lean
IsCoprime (W.ΨSq (n + 1) * W.ΨSq (n - 1)) (W.ΨSq n) → IsCoprime (W.Φ n) (W.ΨSq n)
```

with **no `[W.IsElliptic]`, no hypothesis on `n`, and no characteristic assumption**.  So the
general-`n` problem is not about `Φ` at all: it is the classical statement that `ψₘ` and `ψₙ` have
no common root when `gcd(m, n) = 1`, specialised to `m = n ± 1`.

⚠️ **This proves no new coprimality.**  It transports one, and it is recorded here because the
board had the general case filed as *"a much larger induction"* with no route written down; the
route is now written down and the remaining obligation is a statement about `ΨSq` alone.  The two
`example`s at the end of the file discharge that obligation at `n = 2` and `n = 3` and so recover
both merged results through the general lemma — `n = 3` included, whose hand proof is precisely
this argument done once by hand.

## ⚠️ The pointwise weakening is not a cheaper target, and that is a negative result

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulSurjective` reduces surjectivity of `[n]` on `E(F̄)` to two inputs, of
which the second is **not** the coprimality above but the strictly weaker pointwise statement

```lean
∀ x, (W.ΨSq n).eval x = 0 → (W.Φ n).eval x ≠ 0
```

and that file records that this tree obtains the weakening at `n = 2` and `n = 3` with no Bézout
certificate at all, where the `IsCoprime` instances here cost a `Δ²` certificate and a congruence
argument reusing it.  On that evidence `#1184`'s planning note asks whether the weakening is the
cheaper **general** target and should be spiked first.

The answer is **no**, and `eval_Φ_ne_zero_iff_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero` is the reason: at a root of
`ΨSqₙ` the identity `Φ_eq_neg_adjacent_add` leaves `Φₙ(x) = −preΨₙ₊₁(x)·preΨₙ₋₁(x)·Eₙ(x)`, whose
square is `ΨSqₙ₊₁(x)·ΨSqₙ₋₁(x)` by `ΨSq_succ_mul_ΨSq_pred`.  Over a ring with no zero divisors that
makes the pointwise statement for `(Φₙ, ΨSqₙ)` **equivalent** to the pointwise statement for the
adjacent pair, where the `IsCoprime` reduction is an implication in one direction only.

⚠️ **So the weakening buys exactly the Bézout certificate and nothing else.**  It does not touch the
`ΨSq`-neighbour difficulty, which is the whole of what survives either reduction.  A worker
choosing between the two general targets is choosing between `IsCoprime (ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁) (ΨSqₙ)`
and *"`ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁` and `ΨSqₙ` have no common root"*, and both floors recorded in
*"What is not here"* below apply to the second exactly as they apply to the first.

⚠️ **What this does not say.**  It does not say the two general targets are equivalent — they are
not, and `#1184`'s remains the stronger.  It says that the `Φ`-to-`ΨSq` *reduction step*, which is
where the observed `n = 2`/`n = 3` saving lives, is available in both registers at the same price.
Whether a future proof of the surviving `ΨSq` obligation is easier pointwise than in Bézout form is
untouched by anything here.

⚠️ **One thing the pointwise register does buy, and it is a hypothesis count rather than a route.**
The two `example`s at the end of the file land the `hroot` instances
`eval_Φ_two_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq` and `eval_Φ_three_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq` with `[IsAlgClosed F]` and
`(2 : F) ≠ 0` **both dropped**, because they go through `isCoprime_Ψ₃_Ψ₂Sq` in this file rather
than through a statement about the points above an `x`.

⚠️ **That sentence used to end *"it is measured in that section and acted on nowhere"*, and it has
since been acted on.**  Both downstream statements were narrowed to exactly the hypotheses measured
here, in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective` and
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingSurjective`, which import this file directly and transitively.
Nothing in this file moved: the two `example`s stay `example`s, and what they measure is now what
the two downstream theorems say.

## Main definitions and statements

⚠️ Every public declaration of this file is listed.  Two of them are `def`s, which is why the
heading is not `## Main results`.

* `WeierstrassCurve.bezoutΦTwo` and `WeierstrassCurve.bezoutΨ₂Sq` — the two Sylvester-adjugate
  cofactors the `Δ²` certificate is stated with;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Φ_two_eq` — `Φ₂ = X·Ψ₂Sq − Ψ₃` (**relocated** here from
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`, which now imports it);
* `WeierstrassCurve.bezout_Φ_two_Ψ₂Sq` and `WeierstrassCurve.bezout_Ψ₃_Ψ₂Sq` — the certificates;
* `WeierstrassCurve.preΨ₄_sq_eq_Ψ₂Sq_pow_add_Ψ₃_mul` — the `n = 3` congruence, over an arbitrary
  commutative ring;
* **`WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_Φ_two_Ψ₂Sq`**, **`WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_Ψ₃_Ψ₂Sq`**,
  `WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_preΨ₄_Ψ₃` and **`WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_Φ_three_ΨSq_three`** —
  the coprimality, for `[W.IsElliptic]`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Φ_eq_neg_adjacent_add` and `WeierstrassCurve.ΨSq_succ_mul_ΨSq_pred` — the two
  unconditional identities behind the general-`n` reduction;
* **`WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent`** and its two-hypothesis form
  `WeierstrassCurve.isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq` — the reduction itself, at every `n : ℤ` over
  an arbitrary commutative ring;
* `WeierstrassCurve.eval_Φ_sq_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero` — at a root of `ΨSqₙ`, `Φₙ(x)² =
  ΨSqₙ₊₁(x)·ΨSqₙ₋₁(x)`, over an arbitrary commutative ring;
* `WeierstrassCurve.eval_Φ_ne_zero_of_eval_ΨSq_adjacent_ne_zero` and its two-factor form
  `WeierstrassCurve.eval_Φ_ne_zero_of_eval_ΨSq_ne_zero` — the pointwise reduction;
* **`WeierstrassCurve.eval_Φ_ne_zero_iff_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero`** and its quantified form
  `WeierstrassCurve.forall_eval_Φ_ne_zero_iff` — the pointwise reduction as an **equivalence**, for
  `[NoZeroDivisors R]`.

## What is *not* here

* The general `IsCoprime (W.Φ n) (W.ΨSq n)`. Only `n = 2` and `n = 3` are proved, and — as *"The
  `n = 3` certificate is a congruence, not a resultant"* above sets out — `n = 3` is **not** a
  certificate of its own: it runs through `preΨ₄_sq_eq_Ψ₂Sq_pow_add_Ψ₃_mul` and back to the `n = 2`
  certificate, so `bezout_Φ_two_Ψ₂Sq` and `bezout_Ψ₃_Ψ₂Sq` remain the only `Δ²`-identities here.
  The general case is `#1184`, and `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNPlacePullback`'s rung-3
  paragraph names it as one of the inputs that `[F(W) : [n]∗F(W)] = n²` at general `n` still needs.
  ⚠️ **The clause this bullet used to carry has been corrected** — it read *"each by its own ad-hoc
  certificate"*, which the section named above contradicts.
  ⚠️ **A second clause has been narrowed**: it read *"the general case is a much larger
  induction"*, with no route written down.  Half of it is now discharged unconditionally — see
  *"At general `n`, `Φ` is not the difficulty"* above — and what an induction is still owed is
  `IsCoprime (W.ΨSq (n + 1) * W.ΨSq (n - 1)) (W.ΨSq n)`, in which `Φ` does not appear.
* **`IsCoprime (W.ΨSq (n + 1) * W.ΨSq (n - 1)) (W.ΨSq n)` at general `n`** — the obligation the
  reduction leaves, and the only thing between this file and the general case.  ⚠️ Its pointwise
  weakening, *"`ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁` and `ΨSqₙ` have no common root in `R`"*, is **equally** missing and
  is the obligation the pointwise reduction leaves; see *"The pointwise weakening is not a cheaper
  target"* above, and read both floors below as applying to it too.  Neither route to it
  is available in this development, and it is worth saying where each stops:
  * the **root argument** — a common root would be an `x`-coordinate that is both `n`- and
    `(n ± 1)`-torsion, hence `O`, which is not affine — needs the torsion characterisation
    `n • P = O ↔ Ψₙ(x P) = 0` (`#251`) and a base change to `F̄`.  Neither is imported here.
  * the **recurrence argument** runs through the divisibility structure of `preΨ`, which is
    Mathlib's `preNormEDS (W.Ψ₂Sq ^ 2) W.Ψ₃ W.preΨ₄`.  ⚠️ That `normEDS` satisfies
    `IsEllipticDvdSequence` is an explicit **Mathlib TODO**
    (`Mathlib.NumberTheory.EllipticDivisibilitySequence`).  `IsEllipticDvdSequence` is
    `IsEllipticSequence ∧ IsDvdSequence`, and its **first** conjunct is what this development
    tracks as `#254` / `#258` / `#260`.  ⚠️ Even granted in full it yields *divisibility*, not the
    strong-divisibility `gcd(ψₘ, ψₙ) = ψ_{gcd(m, n)}` that coprimality of neighbours needs — so it
    is a lower bound on the work here, not a route.
* Any statement about **torsion points**, or `n • P = O ↔ Ψₙ = 0`.  ⚠️ **This bullet used to read
  *"Any statement about roots, torsion points, or `n • P = O ↔ Ψₙ = 0`"*, and the first word of that
  list is no longer true**: `eval_Φ_sq_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero` and the three statements built on it are
  statements about roots.  What has not changed, and is what the bullet was protecting, is that no
  root here is ever the `x`-coordinate of a point — the pointwise statements quantify over `x : R`
  and know nothing of `W.Point`, so the torsion characterisation is still absent and still `#251`.
* Anything about `RatFunc`, function fields, or the degree of `[n]`. The consumers are the middle
  steps of the towers computing `[F(W) : [2]∗F(W)] = 4` and `[F(W) : [3]∗F(W)] = 9`, in
  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByTwoDegree` and
  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByThreeDegree`; each reads `Φₙ/ΨSqₙ` as a reduced fraction and
  needs exactly the coprimality proved here.

/-- **`Φ₂ = X · Ψ₂Sq - Ψ₃`.** Both sides are `X⁴ - b₄X² - 2b₆X - b₈`: the `X³` terms of `X · Ψ₂Sq`

It is also what transfers the Bézout certificate below from `Φ₂` to `Ψ₃`.

**Relocated, not new.**  This lemma was proved in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`; it is
a general fact about `Φ`, `Ψ₂Sq` and `Ψ₃` over an arbitrary commutative ring, with no torsion point
in it, so it belongs at the bottom of the import hierarchy rather than in the torsion tree.  That
file now imports it from here; the proof is unchanged. -/

/-! ### The `n = 3` certificate, via a congruence rather than a resultant -/

/-- **`preΨ₄² ≡ Ψ₂Sq⁴ modulo Ψ₃`**, with the cofactor written out.

The naive route to `IsCoprime (Φ₃) (ΨSq₃)` is a Bézout certificate for the pair itself, whose
Sylvester matrix is `17 × 17`; the resultant has weight `48` in `b₂, …, b₈` and neither it nor its
cofactors is a polynomial a `ring1` call would survive.  This congruence replaces the whole of it,
and it is small because it is a *composite* of two facts already in the tree:

* `ψ₂(2P) = ψ₄(P)/ψ₂(P)⁴` — in univariate form, `preΨ₄²` is `Ψ₂Sq` evaluated at the duplication
  fraction `Φ₂/Ψ₂Sq`, cleared of denominators:
  `preΨ₄² = 4Φ₂³ + b₂Φ₂²Ψ₂Sq + 2b₄Φ₂Ψ₂Sq² + b₆Ψ₂Sq³`;
* `Φ_two_eq`, i.e. `Φ₂ = X·Ψ₂Sq − Ψ₃`.

Substituting the second into the first and discarding every term carrying a factor `Ψ₃` leaves
`Ψ₂Sq³·(4X³ + b₂X² + 2b₄X + b₆) = Ψ₂Sq⁴`; what is discarded is `Ψ₃` times the cofactor below.
Geometrically: a point with `Ψ₃(x) = 0` has `2P = −P`, so `ψ₂(2P)² = ψ₂(P)²` up to the fourth power
of `ψ₂(P)` coming from the denominator — a `4`-torsion point is never `3`-torsion.

As with `bezout_Φ_two_Ψ₂Sq` the identity is **false** in the free ring `ℤ[b₂, b₄, b₆, b₈][X]` and
holds only against `b_relation`, which is why the proof is a `linear_combination` and not a
`ring1`; the correction term is the explicit degree-`8` multiplier below.  Nothing is divided by, so
this holds in every characteristic. -/

Everything in this section holds over an arbitrary commutative ring, at every `n : ℤ`, with no
`[W.IsElliptic]` and no hypothesis on `n`.  It is stated separately from the two certificates above
because it proves no coprimality at all: it *transports* one.

rearranged so that the `ΨSqₙ`-multiple is visible.

which is exactly `Eₙ²`.  Nothing is divided by and no hypothesis on `n` is needed. -/

/-- **`IsCoprime (Φₙ) (ΨSqₙ)` follows from coprimality of the *adjacent* division polynomials**,
at every `n : ℤ`, over an arbitrary commutative ring, with no `[W.IsElliptic]`.

Modulo `ΨSqₙ` the identity `Φ_eq_neg_adjacent_add` leaves `Φₙ ≡ −preΨₙ₊₁ · preΨₙ₋₁ · Eₙ`, and
`ΨSq_succ_mul_ΨSq_pred` says the square of that product is `ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁`.  A factor of a
coprime element is coprime, so the hypothesis descends to the product itself and
`IsCoprime.add_mul_left_left` finishes.

/-! ### The pointwise reduction, and why the weaker statement is not the cheaper target

⚠️ **`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulSurjective` does not consume `IsCoprime (Φₙ) (ΨSqₙ)`.**  Its
surjectivity engine takes the strictly weaker *pointwise* hypothesis
`∀ x, ΨSqₙ(x) = 0 → Φₙ(x) ≠ 0`, and recorded that this tree obtained that weakening at `n = 2` and
`n = 3` without any Bézout certificate — where the two `IsCoprime` instances above cost an explicit
`Δ²` certificate and a congruence argument reusing it.  `#1184`'s planning note asks, on that
evidence, whether the pointwise statement is therefore the cheaper **general** target and should be
spiked first.

⚠️ **The past tense is deliberate.**  The two certificate-free arguments still exist, as `example`s
in the two downstream files, but they are no longer how those files' `hroot` instances are proved:
both now route through this file, paying a `Δ`-certificate for a *neighbouring* pair in order to
drop `[IsAlgClosed F]` and `(2 : F) ≠ 0`.  That trade changes nothing below — the question `#1184`'s
note asks is about general `n`, where neither certificate is available at all.

The lemmas below answer that, and the answer is **no**.  At a root of `ΨSqₙ` the identity
`Φ_eq_neg_adjacent_add` leaves `Φₙ(x) = −preΨₙ₊₁(x) · preΨₙ₋₁(x) · Eₙ(x)`, whose square is
`ΨSqₙ₊₁(x) · ΨSqₙ₋₁(x)` by `ΨSq_succ_mul_ΨSq_pred`.  So over a ring with no zero divisors the
pointwise statement for `(Φₙ, ΨSqₙ)` is **equivalent** to the pointwise statement for the adjacent
pair — `eval_Φ_ne_zero_iff_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero` — exactly as
`isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent` makes the Bézout statements interderivable in one
direction.

⚠️ **What the weakening buys is therefore precisely the Bézout certificate and nothing else.**  It
does not touch the `ΨSq`-neighbour difficulty, which is the whole of what survives the reduction
above and is what this file's `## What is *not* here` records as open.  A worker choosing between
the two targets is choosing between `IsCoprime (ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁) (ΨSqₙ)` and *"`ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁`
and `ΨSqₙ` have no common root in `R`"*; the `Φ` in the question was never the difficulty in either
form.

Everything here holds at every `n : ℤ` with no `[W.IsElliptic]` and no hypothesis on `n`; only the
converse direction asks for `[NoZeroDivisors R]`, and it asks for it because `a ^ 2 = 0` does not
imply `a = 0` in a ring with nilpotents.
-/

/-- **At a root of `ΨSqₙ`, the square of `Φₙ` is the adjacent product.**

`Φ_eq_neg_adjacent_add` writes `Φₙ` as `−preΨₙ₊₁ · preΨₙ₋₁ · Eₙ + ΨSqₙ · X`, so the `ΨSqₙ`-multiple
drops out at a root and what is left is `±` the adjacent product; `ΨSq_succ_mul_ΨSq_pred` says the
square of that product is `ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁`, and the sign disappears in the squaring.

⚠️ The hypothesis is used exactly once and only to delete the `ΨSqₙ · X` term.  Nothing here is
divided by, so this holds over an arbitrary commutative ring at every `n : ℤ`. -/

This is the direction the surjectivity engine of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulSurjective` consumes,
and like the `IsCoprime` reduction it eliminates `Φ` from the problem.  It needs no hypothesis on
`R` beyond `CommRing`: if `Φₙ(x)` were `0` its square would be `0` too, and
`eval_Φ_sq_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero` identifies that square with the adjacent product. -/

`eval_Φ_ne_zero_of_eval_ΨSq_adjacent_ne_zero` is unconditional too, so nothing above rules out
*its* hypothesis being unsatisfiable.  The two examples below discharge it at `n = 2` and `n = 3`
from the same inputs the two `IsCoprime` examples use, one point at a time.

⚠️ **What they land already exists downstream, and this is a measurement rather than a
duplication.**  Their conclusions are the conclusions of `eval_Φ_two_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`) and `eval_Φ_three_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingSurjective`) — the two `hroot` instances of
`exists_nsmul_eq_of_hasXCoordFormula` — character for character once `Affine F` is unfolded to
`WeierstrassCurve F`, which it is by `abbrev`.

⚠️ **The three sentences that used to follow have been acted on and are retired.**  They read:

> **The hypotheses are not the same**, and that is the point of putting them here: the merged
> statements carry, at `n = 2` and at `n = 3` alike, `[Field F]`, `[IsAlgClosed F]`,
> `[W.IsElliptic]` and `(2 : F) ≠ 0`; the route below carries `[CommRing R]`, `[IsDomain R]` and
> `[W.IsElliptic]`, and nothing else. … **Nothing is changed at either site here** — narrowing a
> merged signature is a separate decision with its own call-site check, and this section records
> the measurement so that decision can be made on it.

That decision has been made and the call-site check run: both downstream statements now carry
`[Field F]` and `[W.IsElliptic]` and nothing else, and each is proved by the corresponding
`example` below, transcribed into the ambient `[Field F]`.  The remaining difference is only that
those files fix a field where this one takes a domain.

⚠️ **What the narrowing cost, recorded here because this is where the trade is visible.**  The
merged proofs reached `hroot` through `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeTorsionStructure`), a statement about the points above an `x`, which
is where the closure and the characteristic condition came from — and which needs **no Bézout
certificate of any kind**.  The route below reaches it through `isCoprime_Ψ₃_Ψ₂Sq` and
`isCoprime_preΨ₄_Ψ₃`, which carry neither hypothesis but **do** rest on the `Δ` certificates at the
top of this file.  Both downstream files therefore keep their old proof verbatim, as an `example`
under the old hypotheses, so that neither route leaves the tree.

⚠️ **`DoublingSurjective` imports this file directly and `TriplingSurjective` imports
`DoublingSurjective`**, which is what made the narrowing a `#699`-class de-duplication question
rather than an import problem.

⚠️ **They are `example`s and not theorems** for the reason the `IsCoprime` pair above gives: the
statements already have names downstream, and a third name on the same statement is the worse
outcome.

⚠️ **`[IsDomain R]` appears here and nowhere else in this file**, and it is spent in three places,
none of them in a general statement: `pow_ne_zero` at `n = 2`, `pow_eq_zero_iff` extracting
`Ψ₃(x) = 0` from `ΨSq₃(x) = 0` at `n = 3` — both `NoZeroDivisors` — and `Nontrivial` inside the
`IsCoprime`-to-root helper below, without which `1 = 0` is not a contradiction.  The general lemmas
