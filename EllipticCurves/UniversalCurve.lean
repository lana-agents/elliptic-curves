# The universal Weierstrass curve and the specialisation homomorphism

A statement about *every* Weierstrass curve over *every* commutative ring is a statement about
**one** curve over **one** ring, provided the statement is stable under base change.  The curve is
the **universal** one,

`univ : WeierstrassCurve (MvPolynomial (Fin 5) ℤ)`, with `aᵢ = MvPolynomial.X i`,

and the base change is along the **specialisation homomorphism** `W.specialize : S →+* R` sending
`X i` to the corresponding coefficient of `W`, for which `univ.map W.specialize = W`.

`S = MvPolynomial (Fin 5) ℤ` is a characteristic-`0` integral domain, which is what makes the
reduction worth performing: over `S` (or over `S ⊗ ℚ`, or over its fraction field) arguments are
available that are not available over a general `CommRing` — no torsion in the coefficients, no
`2 = 0`, and a fraction field to work in.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.univ` : the universal Weierstrass curve.
* `WeierstrassCurve.specialize` : the specialisation homomorphism `S →+* R` attached to a curve.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.univ_map_specialize` : `univ.map W.specialize = W`.

## Implementation notes

This file imports **only** Mathlib, deliberately.  Both of its consumers — the formal-group
identification in `EllipticCurves.FormalGroup.UniversalIdentification` /
`EllipticCurves.FormalGroup.GenuineLawTransfer`, and the division-polynomial reduction in
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaUniversal` — sit in unrelated corners of the library, and the
universal curve depends on nothing from either.  The three declarations below were originally
written inside the formal-group files and are unchanged by the move.
