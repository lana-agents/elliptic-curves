# The Newton-polygon dichotomy for a Weierstrass equation

Let `v` be a valuation on a field `K`, with values in an arbitrary linearly ordered commutative
group with zero, and let `W` be a Weierstrass curve over `K` **all of whose coefficients are
`v`-integral** (`v aᵢ ≤ 1`).  If a point `(x, y)` on `W` has a pole in the `x`-coordinate
(`1 < v x`), then it has one in the `y`-coordinate too, and

```
(v y) ^ 2 = (v x) ^ 3,
```

the multiplicative form of `2·ord y = 3·ord x`.  This is the statement that the Newton polygon of
the Weierstrass equation at a pole has the single slope `3/2` — the reason the point at infinity of
a Weierstrass curve is a *double* pole of `x` and a *triple* pole of `y`.

## Why the general value group

The argument never divides by `2` or by `3`; it only ever compares integer powers of `v x` and
`v y`.  So no discreteness assumption is needed, and in particular this applies to a valuation
whose value group is not yet known to be `ℤ`.  Two developments in this repository consume it at
different generality:

* `EllipticCurves.Reduction.PointValuation` — at `v = valuation K (maximalIdeal R)` for a discrete
  valuation ring `R` with `IsIntegral R W` (Silverman AEC VII.2 Prop 2.1, the kernel of reduction);
* `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.ValuationAtInfinity` — at an arbitrary valuation subring of the
  function field `F(W)` containing `F`, where discreteness is a *conclusion* rather than a
  hypothesis, and the value group is `O.ValueGroup`.

Stating it once, with the coefficient bounds as hypotheses, is what lets both use it.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_pow_two_eq_pow_three_of_valuation_le_one` — the dichotomy above;
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_le_one_of_valuation_le_one` — the complementary branch: if `v x ≤ 1`
  then `v y ≤ 1`.  Together the two say that a point of `W` is `v`-integral in `y` as soon as it is
  `v`-integral in `x`, which is the "no pole in `x`" half of the classification of the places of a
  function field.

/-- **Newton-polygon dichotomy for a Weierstrass equation.**  If every coefficient of `W` is
`v`-integral and a point `(x, y)` of `W` has `1 < v x`, then `1 < v y` and `(v y) ^ 2 = (v x) ^ 3`.

The proof takes the valuation of both sides of `y² + a₁xy + a₃y = x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆`.  Since
`1 < v x` and every `v aᵢ ≤ 1`, the right side is dominated by `x³`, so `v (RHS) = (v x) ^ 3`.  On
the left, first `1 < v y` (else every term has valuation `≤ v x < (v x) ^ 3`), then a trichotomy on
`(v y) ^ 2` against `v (a₁xy + a₃y)` shows `(v y) ^ 2` is the strictly dominant term.

Every comparison is between integer powers of `v x` and `v y`; nothing is halved, so no
discreteness of `v` is used or needed. -/

/-- **The complementary branch of the dichotomy.**  If every coefficient of `W` is `v`-integral and
a point `(x, y)` of `W` has `v x ≤ 1`, then `v y ≤ 1` as well: an affine point cannot have a pole in
`y` alone.

Classically this is the statement that `y` is integral over `R[x]`, obtained from the monic
quadratic `Y² + (a₁x + a₃)Y − (x³ + a₂x² + a₄x + a₆)` that `y` satisfies; the valuation-theoretic
proof below avoids any integral-closure API.  If `1 < v y` then `v (y²) = (v y)²` strictly dominates
both `v (a₁xy) ≤ v y` and `v (a₃y) ≤ v y`, so the left side of the Weierstrass equation has
valuation `(v y)² > 1`, while every term on the right is `v`-integral.

As with the other branch, no discreteness of `v` is used. -/
