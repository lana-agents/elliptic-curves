# Reduce-to-kernel and reduced-vertical cases of `redPt` additivity (issue #382)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R` and residue field `k`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` have good reduction.  This file proves the two structurally cleanest
special cases of the homomorphism property `redPt (P + Q) = redPt P + redPt Q` of the
point-reduction map `redPt : (W⁄K).Point → (reduction R W).Point`
(see `EllipticCurves/Reduction/PointReduction.lean`).

⚠️ This paragraph used to call that property *"still open in general"*.  **It is not, and has not
been since the day this file landed**: `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add`
(`EllipticCurves/Reduction/ReductionHom.lean`) proves it for all `P, Q`, in a file that imports
*this* one.  The clause survived because nothing in a build can fail on it.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_of_reducesToZero` — **kernel × kernel additivity.**  If both `P` and
  `Q` reduce to the origin (`P, Q ∈ E₁(K)`), then `redPt (P + Q) = redPt P + redPt Q` (all three are
  `0`).  This is the restriction of the homomorphism property to `E₁(K) × E₁(K)`; it follows from
  the full add-closure `reducesToZero_add` of `EllipticCurves/Reduction/KernelAddClosure.lean`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_of_reducesToZero_left` / `redPt_add_of_reducesToZero_right` — the same
  (so **both** summands are still assumed in `E₁(K)`), phrased as `redPt (P + Q) = redPt Q` (resp.
  `= redPt P`).  Note these are *not* the general "kernel acts trivially" statement (`P ∈ E₁(K)`,
  `Q` arbitrary); that is `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_eq_right_of_reducesToZero` /
  `redPt_add_eq_left_of_reducesToZero` (`EllipticCurves/Reduction/ReductionHom.lean`), which is
  downstream of this file.
* `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_of_Y_eq` — **literal vertical.**  If `x₁ = x₂` and `y₁ = negY x₂ y₂`
  over `K`, then `P + Q = O`, so `redPt (P + Q) = 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_of_secant_vertical` — **reduced-vertical secant case.**  For two
  integral points `P = (x₁, y₁)`, `Q = (x₂, y₂)` (`v xᵢ ≤ 1`) with `x₁ ≠ x₂` whose reduced
  `x`-coordinates agree but whose reduced `y`-coordinates differ — captured by the single valuation
  hypothesis `v (x₁ - x₂) < v (y₁ - y₂)` — the secant slope `ℓ = (y₁ - y₂)/(x₁ - x₂)` has a pole, so
  the leading `ℓ²` term of `addX` dominates, giving `1 < v (addX)`; hence `P + Q ∈ E₁(K)` and
  `redPt (P + Q) = 0`.

## What is not covered *here* — both cases have since been proved elsewhere

Two hard sub-cases are outside this file, and no proof holes are left for them (this file is
complete).  Both have since landed, and ⚠️ **one of them by a route this file predicted wrongly** —
which is why the original text is kept as a quotation rather than deleted:

* **Kernel × integral (`redPt (P + Q) = redPt Q` for `P ∈ E₁(K)`, `Q` integral)** — proved as
  `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_of_mem_E₁_left` / `_right`
  (`EllipticCurves/Reduction/KernelIntegralReduction.lean`).

  ⚠️ This paragraph predicted that pinning down `residue (addY) = residue y₂` *"requires a
  **second**-order expansion of `addX - x₂` together with the leading identity `y₁² ≈ x₁³`"*.  **It
  does not.**  The merged proof substitutes the two Weierstrass equations **once**, obtaining the
  two exact identities `(addX - x₂)·d² = P₁` and `(negAddY - negY x₂ y₂)·d³ = P₂` and reading off
  their weights against the Newton-polygon dichotomy.  *The obstruction was in the bookkeeping, not
  in the order of the expansion.*
* **Reduced-vertical doubling / `2`-torsion (`x₁ = x₂` over `K` but not literally negating, or the
  secant `2`-torsion edge `v (y₁ - y₂) ≥ v (x₁ - x₂)`)** — proved as
  `WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add_of_reduced_two_torsion_secant` /
  `redPt_add_self_of_reduced_two_torsion` (`EllipticCurves/Reduction/TwoTorsionReduction.lean`), by
  exactly the route this file named: the reduced tangent denominator vanishes, the slope is a pole,
  and the `ℓ²` term of `addX` dominates.

⚠️ The two are therefore *not* "the same missing reduced-`addY`-residue analysis": one needed a
different substitution and the other needed a different non-vanishing input.  With them, the full
`WeierstrassCurve.redPt_add` is assembled in `EllipticCurves/Reduction/ReductionHom.lean`.

(`P, Q ∈ E₁(K)`), then `redPt (P + Q) = redPt P + redPt Q`.  All three terms are `0`: `redPt P` and
`redPt Q` vanish by `redPt_eq_zero_iff`, and `P + Q` again reduces to the origin by the

/-! ### The reduced-vertical secant case -/

open Classical in
/-- **Reduced-vertical secant case.**  For two integral points `P = (x₁, y₁)`, `Q = (x₂, y₂)`
(`v xᵢ ≤ 1`) with `x₁ ≠ x₂` whose reduced `x`-coordinates agree but whose reduced `y`-coordinates
differ — the single valuation hypothesis being `v (x₁ - x₂) < v (y₁ - y₂)` — the secant slope
`ℓ = (y₁ - y₂)/(x₁ - x₂)` has a pole, `1 < v ℓ`.  In the `x`-coordinate
`addX = ℓ² + a₁ℓ - a₂ - x₁ - x₂` of `P + Q` the term `ℓ²` then strictly dominates every other term
(each of valuation `≤ v ℓ < v ℓ²` or `≤ 1 < v ℓ²`), so `1 < v (addX)`; hence `P + Q ∈ E₁(K)` and
`redPt (P + Q) = 0`.

This is the "reduced points are negatives" secant configuration, whenever the reduced points are
*not* `2`-torsion (equivalently `v (y₁ - y₂) < 1`, so `ȳ₁ ≠ ȳ₂`). -/
