# Potential multiplicative reduction forces `v_R(j) < 0` at the base (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be elliptic.  This file delivers the **ungated forward obstruction** of the
multiplicative half of Silverman AEC VII.5.5 in its quantified, base-landing form — the exact
multiplicative companion of the merged good-reduction brick
`WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_over` (#504,
`Reduction/PotentialGoodReduction.lean`):

> If `W` acquires **multiplicative reduction over a discrete valuation subring `A ⊆ L`** of some
> field extension `L / K`, and `A` **lies over the base DVR `R`**, then the base valuation of the
> `j`-invariant is negative: `1 < v_R(W.j)` (multiplicative-valuation convention), equivalently
> `W.j` is **not integral at the base place**.

The sharp conclusion `1 < v_R(W.j)` is the base-place reflection of
`WeierstrassCurve.one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` (`v(j) < 0` over a single DVR,
`Reduction/JInvariantMultiplicativeReduction.lean`), obtained from the per-extension core
`WeierstrassCurve.not_mem_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange` (#505,
`Reduction/JInvariantMultiplicativeReductionBaseChange.lean`, only `algebraMap K L W.j ∉ A`) by
reflecting the extension-place non-membership back to the base valuation via the DVR converse
`WeierstrassCurve.exists_algebraMap_eq_of_valuation_le_one` (#504).

## Key points

* **"Lies over `R`".** The condition that the valuation subring `A ⊆ L` "lies over" the base is
  packaged as `∀ r : R, algebraMap K L (algebraMap R K r) ∈ A`, i.e. the base ring `R` maps into
  `A` through the tower `R → K → L` (`R ⊆ A ∩ K`).  This is the honest structural meaning of
  "lies over" and the mirror of #504's contraction bound `A ∩ K ⊆ R`.  It does **not** smuggle the
  theorem's content: the content — multiplicative reduction ⟹ `j ∉ A` — is #505.

* **The reflection.** If `v_R(W.j) ≤ 1` then by the DVR converse `W.j = algebraMap R K r` for some
  `r : R`, whence `algebraMap K L W.j ∈ A` by `hover r`, contradicting #505.  So `1 < v_R(W.j)`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over` — the sharp
  `∀`-form: multiplicative reduction of `W⁄L` over any DVR extension `A` lying over `R` forces
  `1 < v_R(W.j)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_isIntegral_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over` — the
  membership corollary: `¬ ∃ r : R, algebraMap R K r = W.j` (`W.j` not integral at the base place).
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over_of_j_mem` — the contrapositive:
  a `j` integral at the base place rules out multiplicative reduction over any DVR extension lying
  over `R`.

## Scope

This delivers the **ungated forward obstruction**.  The **converse** (`v(j) < 0` ⟹ potential
multiplicative reduction) needs the Tate curve, absent from the repository and the pinned Mathlib,
and is left to a follow-on — exactly as for #504/#505.
