# `redPt` additivity on the good-secant locus (issue #380)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R` and residue field
`k = ResidueField R`, and let `W : WeierstrassCurve K` have good reduction.  This file proves the
**secant case** of the point-reduction homomorphism property (parent #360):
```
redPt R W (P + Q) = redPt R W P + redPt R W Q
```
whenever `P = (x₁, y₁)` and `Q = (x₂, y₂)` are integral points whose reductions have **distinct
`x`-coordinates** (`residue x̄₁ ≠ residue x̄₂`).  In that configuration `P + Q` is computed by the
secant addition formula, and — crucially — the difference of the reduced `x`-coordinates is a unit,
so the `K`-slope is *integral* and its residue is the slope on the reduced curve
(`exists_lift_slope_of_reduced_X_ne`, issue #379).

The proof is a pure assembly of the ring-hom-commuting coordinate formulas
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.map_addX` / `map_addY` (which hold for *any* ring homomorphism, no
injectivity required) applied to both `algebraMap R K` (to lift the sum's coordinates to `R`) and
`residue R` (to identify their residues with the reduced-curve `addX`/`addY`).  It mirrors the
structure of `redPt_neg` (`PointReduction.lean`).

/-- **`redPt` additivity, good-secant case.**  For integral points `P = (x₁, y₁)`, `Q = (x₂, y₂)`
of `W` whose reductions have distinct `x`-coordinates (`residue x₀₁ ≠ residue x₀₂`), the reduction
of the secant sum is the sum of the reductions:
`redPt (P + Q) = redPt P + redPt Q`.

Because `residue x₀₁ ≠ residue x₀₂`, the difference `x₀₁ - x₀₂` is a unit, so the secant `K`-slope
is integral with residue the reduced-curve slope (`exists_lift_slope_of_reduced_X_ne`, #379).
Lifting through `algebraMap R K` and reducing through `residue R` the same integral-model
`addX`/`addY` polynomials — both of which commute with any ring homomorphism
(`Affine.map_addX`/`map_addY`) — identifies the reduced coordinates of `P + Q` with the coordinates
of `redPt P + redPt Q`. -/
