# The `c₆`-signature of node vs cusp (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be given by a *minimal* Weierstrass equation (`IsMinimal R W`).  The
node/cusp classification of `ReductionNodeCusp.lean` (#490/#491) reads the bad-reduction type
off the reduced curve's discriminant `Δ̃` and `c₄`-invariant `c̃₄`:

* **multiplicative** (a **node**) ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₄ ≠ 0`;
* **additive** (a **cusp**) ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₄ = 0`.

It says nothing about the third invariant `c̃₆`.  This file supplies the missing `c₆` half using
Mathlib's invariant relation `c_relation : 1728 · Δ = c₄³ − c₆²`, valid over any `CommRing` and
hence over the residue field `ResidueField R`.  Applied to the reduced curve `W.reduction R` —
where in both bad cases `Δ̃ = 0` — it forces `c̃₆² = c̃₄³`, which pins down `c̃₆`:

* at a **cusp** (`c̃₄ = 0`, `Δ̃ = 0`) it gives `c̃₆² = 0`, hence `c̃₆ = 0`: **all** the reduced
  invariants `c̃₄, c̃₆, Δ̃` vanish;
* at a **node** (`c̃₄ ≠ 0`, `Δ̃ = 0`) it gives `c̃₆² = c̃₄³ ≠ 0`, hence `c̃₆ ≠ 0`.

This is the reduced-curve `c₆`-invariant face of the node/cusp dictionary, the natural sibling of
the `c₄`-only classification.  Everything is pure algebra over the residue field: it uses only
`1728 · 0 = 0` and never `1728 ≠ 0`, so it holds in **every** characteristic, and it is fully
unconditional (only `IsMinimal R W`) — no Tate-curve, valuation-extension, or Néron-model theory.

## Main results

For `W : WeierstrassCurve K` with `[IsMinimal R W]`, in `namespace WeierstrassCurve`:

* `reduction_c₆_eq_zero_iff` — `(W.reduction R).c₆ = 0 ↔ v(c₆) < 1` (the `c₆` sibling of
  `reduction_c₄_eq_zero_iff`);
* `HasAdditiveReduction.reduction_c₆_eq_zero` — a cusp has `c̃₆ = 0`;
* `hasAdditiveReduction_iff_reduction_invariants_eq_zero` — additive reduction ⟺ all three reduced
  invariants `c̃₄, c̃₆, Δ̃` vanish;
* `HasMultiplicativeReduction.reduction_c₆_sq_eq` — a node satisfies `c̃₆² = c̃₄³`;
* `HasMultiplicativeReduction.reduction_c₆_ne_zero` — a node has `c̃₆ ≠ 0`;
* `HasMultiplicativeReduction.reduction_c₄_isSquare` — at a node `c̃₄` is a square.
