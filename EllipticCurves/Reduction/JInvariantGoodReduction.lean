# Good reduction makes the curve elliptic and its `j`-invariant integral (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` have good reduction over `R` (`HasGoodReduction R W`). This file records
two elementary but foundational consequences that open the `j`-invariant / reduction-type theory
of an elliptic curve — the first bricks toward the **potential good reduction** criterion
(Silverman AEC VII.5): a curve with good reduction is elliptic, and its `j`-invariant is *integral*,
i.e. `j ∈ R`
(equivalently `v(j) ≥ 0`).

## Key point

`HasGoodReduction R W` unfolds to `IsMinimal R W` together with
`valuation K (maximalIdeal R) W.Δ = 1`, i.e. the discriminant of the integral minimal model
`integralModel R W` is a **unit** in `R` (this is `isUnit_Δ_integralModel_of_hasGoodReduction`, from
`GoodReductionBaseChange.lean`). A ring homomorphism sends units to units, so `W.Δ` is a unit in the
field `K` and `W` is elliptic. Moreover, writing `j = Δ'⁻¹ · c₄³`, both `Δ` and `c₄` come from the
integral model, so `j` is the image of `↑u⁻¹ · c₄³ ∈ R` under `algebraMap R K` (`u` the unit
discriminant of the integral model). This is the easy `⇐`-adjacent half of the classical statement
that a curve has good reduction only if its `j`-invariant is integral; the converse (integral `j`
implies *potential* good reduction, VII.5.5) needs base-change / valuation-extension infrastructure
and is left to a follow-on.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isElliptic_of_hasGoodReduction` — good reduction implies `W.IsElliptic`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction` — the `j`-invariant of a curve with good
  reduction is integral: `∃ r : R, algebraMap R K r = W.j` (i.e. `v(j) ≥ 0`).
