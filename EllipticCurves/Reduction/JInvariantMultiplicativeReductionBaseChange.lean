# Multiplicative reduction over a DVR extension makes the `j`-invariant non-integral (issue #72)

Let `L / K` be a field extension and `A : ValuationSubring L` a **discrete** valuation subring of
`L`.  This is the abstract shape of "a finite extension `L / K` with `A` the corresponding valuation
ring", exactly as used by the good-reduction base-change brick
`isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange` (`JInvariantGoodReductionBaseChange.lean`, #501).

If a Weierstrass curve `W : WeierstrassCurve K` (elliptic) base changes to a curve `W⁄L` with
**multiplicative reduction over `A`**, then its `j`-invariant `W.j ∈ K` is **not integral at the
base place**: its image `algebraMap K L W.j` lies *outside* `A`, equivalently `W.j` lies outside the
contracted valuation ring `A.comap (algebraMap K L)` of `K`.

This is the **multiplicative-reduction companion** of the good-reduction base-change brick #501
(good reduction ⟹ `j ∈ A`) and the base-landing #504 (potential good reduction ⟹ `j` integral): it
is the *potential multiplicative reduction* obstruction — the base-change reflection of
`not_isIntegral_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` (`JInvariantMultiplicativeReduction.lean`), the
easy direction of Silverman AEC VII.5.1 ("multiplicative reduction is detected by `v(j) < 0`").  As
in
#501 the "`A` lies over the base" condition is free: `ValuationSubring.comap` and
`ValuationSubring.mem_comap` give `x ∈ A.comap f ↔ f x ∈ A`, so no ad-hoc `A ∩ K = R` hypothesis or
ramification-index machinery is needed.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.not_mem_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange` — multiplicative reduction
  of `W⁄L` over `A` implies `algebraMap K L W.j ∉ A`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_mem_comap_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange` — the same, phrased as
  `W.j ∉ A.comap (algebraMap K L)` (the `j`-invariant is *not* integral at the contracted place of
  `K`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_of_j_mem` — the contrapositive: a
  `j`-invariant that *is* integral at the base place rules out multiplicative reduction over `A`.

## Scope

This delivers the reusable *per-extension* core of the multiplicative obstruction.  The full
statement quantifies over all finite extensions `L / K`, and the *converse* (`v(j) < 0` ⟹
*potential* multiplicative reduction, the Tate curve) needs infrastructure absent from the
repository and the pinned Mathlib; both remain larger efforts.

/-- **Multiplicative reduction over a DVR extension forces `j` non-integral at the base.** If the
base change `W⁄L` has multiplicative reduction over the discrete valuation subring `A ⊆ L`, then the
image of the `j`-invariant `algebraMap K L W.j` lies *outside* `A`. This is the base-change
reflection of `not_isIntegral_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` — the multiplicative-reduction
companion of `isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange` (#501). -/
