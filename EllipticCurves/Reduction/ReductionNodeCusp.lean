# Node vs cusp: bad reduction classified by the reduced curve's invariants (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be given by a *minimal* Weierstrass equation (`IsMinimal R W`).  Mathlib
defines the three reduction types of the minimal model by the valuations of `Δ` and `c₄`
(`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/Reduction.lean`):

* good reduction: `v(Δ) = 1` (a unit);
* multiplicative reduction: `v(Δ) < 1` and `v(c₄) = 1`;
* additive reduction: `v(Δ) < 1` and `v(c₄) < 1`.

This file translates that valuation-level dictionary into the **reduced curve's own invariants**.
Since `v(x) < 1 ⟺ x` lies in the maximal ideal `⟺ residue R x = 0`, and reduction commutes with the
invariants (`reduction_Δ_eq`, `reduction_c₄_eq`, #490), the reduction type is read off directly from
whether the discriminant `Δ̃` and the invariant `c̃₄` of the reduced curve `W.reduction R` over the
residue field vanish:

* **good** ⟺ `Δ̃ ≠ 0` (the reduced curve is smooth / elliptic — this is Mathlib's
  `hasGoodReduction_iff_isElliptic_reduction`, restated here as `Δ̃ ≠ 0`);
* **multiplicative** ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₄ ≠ 0` (a **node**);
* **additive** ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₄ = 0` (a **cusp**).

This is the reduced-curve-geometry face of the reduction-type trichotomy — the natural sibling
of the invariant dictionary (#490) and of `hasGoodReduction_iff_isElliptic_reduction`.  It is
fully unconditional (only `IsMinimal R W`) and needs no Tate-curve / valuation-extension theory.

## Main results

For `W : WeierstrassCurve K` with `[IsMinimal R W]`, in `namespace WeierstrassCurve`:

* `reduction_Δ_eq_zero_iff` — `(W.reduction R).Δ = 0 ↔ v(Δ) < 1` (the bad-reduction bridge);
* `reduction_c₄_eq_zero_iff` — `(W.reduction R).c₄ = 0 ↔ v(c₄) < 1`;
* `hasGoodReduction_iff_reduction_Δ_ne_zero` — good reduction ⟺ `(W.reduction R).Δ ≠ 0`;
* `hasMultiplicativeReduction_iff_reduction` — multiplicative reduction ⟺
  `(W.reduction R).Δ = 0 ∧ (W.reduction R).c₄ ≠ 0` (node);
* `hasAdditiveReduction_iff_reduction` — additive reduction ⟺
  `(W.reduction R).Δ = 0 ∧ (W.reduction R).c₄ = 0` (cusp).
