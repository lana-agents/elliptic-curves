# Good reduction over a DVR extension forces the `j`-invariant integral at the base (issue #501)

Let `L / K` be a field extension and `A : ValuationSubring L` a **discrete** valuation subring of
`L`.  This is the abstract shape of "a finite extension `L / K` with `A` the corresponding valuation
ring", exactly as used by the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich *good ⇒ unramified* tree
(`EllipticCurves/Reduction/ReductionUnramified.lean`, with `A.inertiaSubgroup K`).

If a Weierstrass curve `W : WeierstrassCurve K` (elliptic) base changes to a curve `W⁄L` with
**good reduction over `A`**, then its `j`-invariant `W.j ∈ K` is **integral at the base place**: its
image lies in `A`, equivalently `W.j` lies in the contracted valuation ring
`A.comap (algebraMap K L)` of `K`.

This is the **base-change reflection** of the merged good-reduction ⇒ integral-`j` brick
`WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction` (`JInvariantGoodReduction.lean`, issue #483):
the *ungated* direction of Silverman AEC VII.5.5 — "(potential) good reduction ⟹ `j` integral".
The key point is that the "`A` lies over the base" condition is free: `ValuationSubring.comap` and
`ValuationSubring.mem_comap` give `x ∈ A.comap f ↔ f x ∈ A`, so no ad-hoc `A ∩ K = R` hypothesis or
ramification-index machinery is needed.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange` — good reduction of `W⁄L` over `A`
  implies `algebraMap K L W.j ∈ A`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.mem_comap_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange` — the same, phrased as
  `W.j ∈ A.comap (algebraMap K L)` (the `j`-invariant is integral at the contracted place of `K`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_of_j_not_mem` — the contrapositive: a
  `j`-invariant that is not integral at the base place rules out good reduction over `A`.

## Scope

This delivers the reusable *per-extension* core.  The full VII.5.5 statement quantifies over all
finite extensions `L / K` (a `PotentialGoodReduction` predicate, absent from the repo), and its
*converse* (`j` integral ⟹ potential good reduction) needs Tate-curve / valuation-extension
existence infrastructure absent from the repo and the pinned Mathlib; both remain larger efforts.
