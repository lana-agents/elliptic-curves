# The `j`-invariant commutes with good reduction (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` have good reduction over `R` (`HasGoodReduction R W`). The good-reduction
brick `isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction` (`JInvariantGoodReduction.lean`, #483) shows that `W.j` is
*integral*, i.e. it is the image `algebraMap R K r` of some `r : R`. This file pins that witness
down canonically and records the compatibility of the `j`-invariant with the reduction map: the
`j`-invariant of the reduced curve `W.reduction R` (a curve over the residue field `ResidueField R`)
is the **reduction of the `j`-invariant** of the minimal integral model.

## Key point

Under good reduction the integral minimal model `integralModel R W` has a **unit** discriminant
(`isUnit_Δ_integralModel_of_hasGoodReduction`), so it is itself an elliptic curve over `R` and its
`j`-invariant `(integralModel R W).j : R` is defined. Two applications of Mathlib's `map_j`
(functoriality of `j` under a ring map of elliptic curves) then give the two faces of the same
element `(integralModel R W).j ∈ R`:

* pushing along `algebraMap R K` recovers `W.j` (because `(integralModel R W)⁄K = W`), and
* pushing along the residue map `residue R` gives `(W.reduction R).j` (because
  `W.reduction R = (integralModel R W).map (residue R)`).

Together these say the square `R → K`, `R → ResidueField R`, `j ↦ j` commutes: *the `j`-invariant
of the good reduction is the reduction of the `j`-invariant*. This is the natural refinement of
`isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction` and a foundational compatibility for the reduction theory of the
`j`-invariant (Silverman AEC VII.5).

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isElliptic_integralModel_of_hasGoodReduction` — the integral minimal model of a
  curve with good reduction is elliptic (its discriminant is a unit in `R`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.algebraMap_j_integralModel_eq` — the canonical integral witness for `W.j`:
  `algebraMap R K (integralModel R W).j = W.j` (a sharpening of `isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.reduction_j_eq` — the `j`-invariant of the reduction is the residue of the
  integral model's `j`-invariant: `(W.reduction R).j = residue R (integralModel R W).j`.
