# Potential good reduction forces the `j`-invariant integral at the base (issue #504)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be elliptic.  This file delivers the **ungated forward direction** of
Silverman AEC VII.5.5 in its quantified, base-landing form:

> If `W` acquires **good reduction over a discrete valuation subring `A ⊆ L`** of some field
> extension `L / K`, and `A` **lies over the base DVR `R`**, then the `j`-invariant `W.j` is
> **integral at the base place**: `∃ r : R, algebraMap R K r = W.j`.

This is the quantified strengthening of the per-extension core
`WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange` (#501,
`Reduction/JInvariantGoodReductionBaseChange.lean`), which only concludes
`algebraMap K L W.j ∈ A` — membership in the *extension's* valuation ring.  The new content is
landing the conclusion back in the base `R`, which needs the **DVR converse** below (valuation
`≤ 1` at the base place ⟹ membership in `R`), the step #501 deferred.

## Key points

* **The DVR converse** `exists_algebraMap_eq_of_valuation_le_one`: for a discrete valuation ring
  `R` any `x : K` with `v(x) ≤ 1` at the maximal-ideal place lies in the image of `R`.  For a
  general Dedekind domain this fails for a single place, but for a *local* ring the writeup
  `x·d = n` with `d ∈ (maximalIdeal R)ᶜ` (`exists_primeCompl_mul_eq_of_integer`) has `d` a **unit**
  (`IsLocalRing.notMem_maximalIdeal`), so `x = n / d ∈ R`.

* **Lies over `R`.** The condition that the valuation subring `A ⊆ L` "lies over" the base is
  packaged as the contraction bound `∀ x : K, algebraMap K L x ∈ A → v_R(x) ≤ 1`, i.e.
  `A ∩ K ⊆ R`.  This is the honest structural meaning of "lies over" and exactly what turns the
  `#501` conclusion `algebraMap K L W.j ∈ A` into `W.j ∈ R`.  It does **not** smuggle the
  theorem's content: the content — good reduction ⟹ `j ∈ A` — is `#501`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_algebraMap_eq_of_valuation_le_one` — the DVR converse.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_j_le_one_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_over` — the sharp
  base-valuation form `v_R(W.j) ≤ 1`, the good-reduction mirror of the multiplicative
  `one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over` (#509).
* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_over` — the `∀`-form: any DVR
  extension `A` lying over `R` with good reduction of `W⁄L` forces `W.j ∈ R`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_over_of_j_not_mem` — the contrapositive: a
  non-integral `j` rules out good reduction over any DVR extension lying over `R`.

## Scope

This delivers the **ungated forward direction**.  The **converse** (`j` integral ⟹ potential good
reduction) needs the Tate curve / existence of a good-reduction extension, absent from the
repository and the pinned Mathlib, and is left to a follow-on.  A bundled
`HasPotentialGoodReduction` existential predicate is deliberately avoided: quantifying over a
fresh field `L` with its
`Field`/`Algebra` instances inside an `∃` is not ergonomic in Lean 4 (instances bound by an
existential are not registered for typeclass search), and the `∀`-form above carries the same
mathematical content cleanly.

locality of `R` is what upgrades the single-place statement.) -/

a discrete valuation subring `A ⊆ L` that **lies over** `R` (its contraction to `K` bounds the base
