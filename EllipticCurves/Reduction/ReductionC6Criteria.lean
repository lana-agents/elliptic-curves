# The `c₆`-only node/cusp criteria for bad reduction (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be given by a *minimal* Weierstrass equation (`IsMinimal R W`).  The
node/cusp dictionary of `ReductionNodeCusp.lean` (#490/#491) reads the bad-reduction type off the
reduced curve's discriminant `Δ̃` and `c₄`-invariant `c̃₄`, and `ReductionC6Signature.lean` (#495)
supplies the matching `c₆` *implications* — a node has `c̃₆ ≠ 0`, a cusp has `c̃₆ = 0`.  What was
still missing is the clean `c₆`-only **iff** characterizations, the exact mirror of
`ReductionNodeCusp`'s c₄-only `hasMultiplicativeReduction_iff_reduction` /
`hasAdditiveReduction_iff_reduction`.

This file closes that gap.  The key algebraic fact is that among bad reduction (`Δ̃ = 0`) the
invariants `c̃₄` and `c̃₆` vanish together: Mathlib's invariant relation
`c_relation : 1728 · Δ = c₄³ − c₆²`, applied to the reduced curve where `Δ̃ = 0`, gives
`c̃₄³ = c̃₆²`, so in the field `ResidueField R` one is zero iff the other is.  Hence detecting
the node/cusp split
by `c̃₆` is equivalent to detecting it by `c̃₄`:

* **multiplicative** (a **node**) ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₆ ≠ 0`;
* **additive** (a **cusp**) ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₆ = 0`.

Like its `c₄` sibling this is pure residue-field algebra: it uses only `1728 · 0 = 0`, holds in
**every** characteristic, and is fully unconditional (only `IsMinimal R W`) — no Tate-curve,
valuation-extension, or Néron-model theory.

## Main results

For `W : WeierstrassCurve K` with `[IsMinimal R W]`, in `namespace WeierstrassCurve`:

* `reduction_c₄_eq_zero_iff_c₆_eq_zero` — among bad reduction (`Δ̃ = 0`), `c̃₄ = 0 ↔ c̃₆ = 0`;
* `hasMultiplicativeReduction_iff_reduction_c₆` — multiplicative reduction ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₆ ≠ 0`
  (node);
* `hasAdditiveReduction_iff_reduction_c₆` — additive reduction ⟺ `Δ̃ = 0 ∧ c̃₆ = 0` (cusp).

/-- **Among bad reduction, `c̃₄` and `c̃₆` vanish together.** If the reduced curve is singular
(`Δ̃ = 0`) then the invariant relation `1728 · Δ̃ = c̃₄³ − c̃₆²` collapses to `c̃₄³ = c̃₆²`, so over
the field `ResidueField R` the two invariants `c̃₄` and `c̃₆` are simultaneously zero. -/
