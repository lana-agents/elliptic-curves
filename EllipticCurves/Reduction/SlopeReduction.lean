# Integral-slope reduction compatibility on the good-secant locus (issue #379)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R` and residue field
`k = ResidueField R`, and let `W : WeierstrassCurve K` have good reduction.  This file supplies the
**foundational slope lemma** for the point-reduction homomorphism (`redPt` additivity, parent #360):
on the *good-secant* locus — two integral points whose reductions have **distinct `x`-coordinates**
— the secant slope over `K` is integral and its residue equals the slope on the reduced curve.

## Why this is the crux to isolate

Mathlib's functorial `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.map_slope` (`Affine/Formula.lean`) requires the ring
homomorphism to be **injective**; the reduction map `residue R : R → k` is not injective, so the
general lemma does not apply.  The obstruction is genuine only where reduction collapses distinct
`K`-points.  On the good-secant locus, however, the slope is the difference quotient
`(y₁ - y₂) / (x₁ - x₂)` (`Affine.slope_of_X_ne`), and its denominator `x₀₁ - x₀₂` is a **unit** of
the local ring `R` (its residue is nonzero), so the quotient is integral and `residue R` — a genuine
ring homomorphism — commutes with it directly.  No injectivity is needed.  This makes the secant
case elementary and self-contained; it is the piece the secant `redPt`-additivity rung consumes.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.exists_lift_slope_of_reduced_X_ne` — an integral lift `s : R` of the `K`-secant
  slope whose residue is the reduced-curve slope.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_slope_le_one_of_reduced_X_ne` — the secant slope is integral
  (`v (slope) ≤ 1`).

/-- **Integral-slope reduction compatibility (good-secant case).**  Let `P = (x₁, y₁)` and
`Q = (x₂, y₂)` be points of `W` with integral lifts `x₀ᵢ, y₀ᵢ : R` of their coordinates, and suppose
their reductions have distinct `x`-coordinates (`residue x₀₁ ≠ residue x₀₂`).  Then the secant slope
`W.slope x₁ x₂ y₁ y₂ = (y₁ - y₂)/(x₁ - x₂)` is **integral**: it has a lift `s : R` whose residue is
exactly the slope of the reduced curve at the reduced points.

This is the residue-side slope compatibility the secant reduction-additivity rung consumes; because
`x₀₁ - x₀₂` is a unit of the local ring `R`, the difference quotient stays in `R` and the ring
homomorphism `residue R` commutes with it — no injectivity of `residue R` is required. -/
