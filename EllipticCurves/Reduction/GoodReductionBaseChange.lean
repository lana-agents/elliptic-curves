# Good reduction is preserved under base change to a DVR extension (issue #393)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let `A` be a second
discrete valuation ring with fraction field `L = Frac A`, sitting over `R` (so we have compatible
scalar towers `R → A → L` and `R → K → L`; this is the situation of a finite extension `L / K` with
`A` the corresponding valuation ring). If a Weierstrass curve `W : WeierstrassCurve K` has good
reduction over `R`, then its base change `W⁄L : WeierstrassCurve L` has good reduction over `A`.

This is **rung C** of the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich *good ⇒ unramified* ladder (Silverman AEC VII.7.1;
see `EllipticCurves/Reduction/ReductionGaloisEquivariant.lean`, issue #390 for rung A, and the
inertia-bridge issue #392 for rung B). Rung B produces the residue-trivial-torsion conclusion from a
good-reduction hypothesis *over `A`*; this file supplies exactly that hypothesis when `A` arises
from a finite extension.

## Key point

`HasGoodReduction R W` unfolds to `IsMinimal R W` together with
`valuation K (maximalIdeal R) W.Δ = 1`,
i.e. the discriminant of the integral minimal model `integralModel R W` is a **unit** in `R`. A ring
homomorphism sends units to units, so the discriminant stays a unit after base change to `A`; hence
`valuation L (maximalIdeal A) (W⁄L).Δ = 1`, and the base-changed integral model is automatically
minimal (its discriminant valuation already attains the top value `1`, which cannot be exceeded).
No hypothesis on the ramification of `A / R` is needed: good reduction is stable under *arbitrary*
base change. This is the formal reason good reduction is "good".

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_baseChange` — `W⁄L` is integral over `A`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_Δ_baseChange_eq_one` — its discriminant has valuation `1` over `A`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasGoodReduction_baseChange` — `W⁄L` has good reduction over `A`.
