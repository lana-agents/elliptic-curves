# The reduction-type ↔ `v(j)` dictionary: sharp pole order and bad reduction (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K`. This file completes the elementary consequences of the reduction-type ↔
`v(j)` dictionary (Silverman AEC VII.5.1) whose two extremes are already recorded:

* good reduction ⇒ integral `j`
  (`isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction`, `JInvariantGoodReduction.lean`);
* multiplicative reduction ⇒ non-integral `j`
  (`not_isIntegral_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction`, `JInvariantMultiplicativeReduction.lean`).

Everything here is a short consequence of those merged bricks plus Mathlib's reduction-type
trichotomy, and is fully **ungated** (only the DVR valuation API; no valuation-extension,
Tate-curve or normality infrastructure).

## Key point

For multiplicative reduction the valuation of `j` is not merely negative but is pinned exactly:
from `v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ · (v c₄)³` (`valuation_j_eq_of_isElliptic`) and `v(c₄) = 1`
(`HasMultiplicativeReduction.multiplicativeReduction`) it collapses to `v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹`, i.e. the
order of the pole of `j` equals `v(Δ)` — the classical fact `v(j) = -v(Δ)`.
Dually, the good-reduction brick contrapositive says a non-integral `j` rules out good reduction, so
on a minimal model a non-integral `j` forces **bad** reduction (multiplicative or additive).

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` — the sharp identity
  `valuation K (maximalIdeal R) W.j = (valuation K (maximalIdeal R) W.Δ)⁻¹` under multiplicative
  reduction (strengthening `one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction`, which only
  records the sign).
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasGoodReduction_of_not_isIntegral_j` — a non-integral `j`-invariant rules
  out good reduction (contrapositive of `isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasMultiplicativeReduction_or_hasAdditiveReduction_of_not_isIntegral_j` — on a
  minimal model, a non-integral `j`-invariant forces bad reduction:
  `HasMultiplicativeReduction R W ∨ HasAdditiveReduction R W`.

/-- **The pole order of `j` under multiplicative reduction is `v(Δ)`**: the valuation of the
`j`-invariant is exactly `(v Δ)⁻¹`. This sharpens
`one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` (which only records `1 < v(j)`, i.e. the sign),
and is the classical `v(j) = -v(Δ)`. Since `v(c₄) = 1` for multiplicative reduction, the identity
`v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ · (v c₄)³` collapses to `(v Δ)⁻¹`. -/
