# Potential good and potential multiplicative reduction are mutually exclusive (issue #525)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be elliptic.  This file records the **mutual exclusivity** of potential
good reduction and potential multiplicative reduction at the base place, as the immediate joint
consequence of the two sharp base-valuation lemmas of Silverman AEC VII.5.5:

* good reduction over a DVR extension `A ⊆ L` lying over `R` forces `v_R(W.j) ≤ 1`
  (`valuation_j_le_one_of_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_over`, #514);
* multiplicative reduction over a DVR extension `A' ⊆ L'` lying over `R` forces `1 < v_R(W.j)`
  (`one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over`, #509).

`v_R(W.j) ≤ 1` and `1 < v_R(W.j)` are contradictory, so `W` cannot simultaneously acquire good
reduction over one DVR extension of `R` and multiplicative reduction over another.  This is the
base-landing, *potential* (base-change) form of the disjointness of reduction types: the
`v(j) ≥ 0` vs `v(j) < 0` dichotomy of Silverman AEC VII.5.5.

`ReductionTrichotomy.lean` already establishes disjointness of the good/multiplicative/additive
types **over a single fixed DVR** (same place).  The statements here are genuinely different: good
reduction over one extension versus multiplicative reduction over a possibly *different* extension,
both lying over the base `R`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasGoodReduction_and_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over` — the core
  exclusivity: no `W` has good reduction over `A` and multiplicative reduction over `A'`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasMultiplicativeReduction_baseChange_over_of_hasGoodReduction` — good
  reduction over `A` rules out multiplicative reduction over any DVR extension lying over `R`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_hasGoodReduction_baseChange_over_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` — the
  symmetric companion.

## Scope

This is the **ungated forward dichotomy**.  The converse directions (`v(j) ≥ 0` ⟹ potential good,
`v(j) < 0` ⟹ potential multiplicative) need the Tate curve / Néron machinery, absent from the
repository and the pinned Mathlib, and are out of scope — exactly as for #504/#505/#509/#514.
