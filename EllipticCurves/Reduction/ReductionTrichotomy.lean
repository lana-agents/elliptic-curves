# Bad reduction and the exclusive reduction-type trichotomy (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be given by a *minimal* Weierstrass equation (`IsMinimal R W`).  Mathlib
proves that the three reduction types are **exhaustive** — one of good / multiplicative / additive
always holds (`hasGoodReduction_or_hasMultiplicativeReduction_or_hasAdditiveReduction`) — and
provides the six pairwise **mutual-exclusivity** lemmas
(`HasGoodReduction.not_hasMultiplicativeReduction`, etc.).  But it packages neither the combined
"exactly one of" statement nor a `¬ HasGoodReduction ↔ …` characterization of **bad** reduction.

This file supplies both, completing the reduction-type dictionary alongside the node/cusp
classification of `ReductionNodeCusp.lean` (#490/#491):

* **bad reduction = multiplicative or additive**
  (`not_hasGoodReduction_iff_hasMultiplicativeReduction_or_hasAdditiveReduction`);
* **bad ⟺ the reduced curve is singular** `Δ̃ = 0`
  (`not_hasGoodReduction_iff_reduction_Δ_eq_zero`), the complement of
  `hasGoodReduction_iff_reduction_Δ_ne_zero`;
* the **exclusive trichotomy** `hasGoodReduction_trichotomy` — exactly one of the three types holds;
* and the three "one type is the complement of the other two" equivalences.

Everything is pure propositional bookkeeping over the exhaustive `∨`, the six negation lemmas, and
the merged `Δ̃ ≠ 0` good-reduction criterion.  It is fully unconditional (only `IsMinimal R W`) and
needs no Tate-curve / valuation-extension / Néron-model theory.

## Main results

For `W : WeierstrassCurve K` with `[IsMinimal R W]`, in `namespace WeierstrassCurve`:

* `not_hasGoodReduction_iff_hasMultiplicativeReduction_or_hasAdditiveReduction`;
* `not_hasGoodReduction_iff_reduction_Δ_eq_zero`;
* `hasGoodReduction_trichotomy`;
* `hasGoodReduction_iff_not_multiplicative_and_not_additive`;
* `hasMultiplicativeReduction_iff_not_good_and_not_additive`;
* `hasAdditiveReduction_iff_not_good_and_not_multiplicative`.
