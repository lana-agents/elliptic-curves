# The `c₆`-only split multiplicative criterion (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be given by a *minimal* Weierstrass equation (`IsMinimal R W`).  The
discriminant characterization `hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction_iff_isSquare`
(`ReductionSplitMultiplicative.lean`, #494) detects split multiplicative reduction, for residue
characteristic `≠ 2`, by asking that `−c̃₄ · c̃₆` be a square in the residue field.  This file
rewrites that criterion in the **single invariant `c̃₆`**, matching the `c₆`-only node/cusp iffs of
`ReductionC6Criteria.lean` (#496):

* **split multiplicative** ⟺ `W` has multiplicative reduction and `IsSquare (−c̃₆)`.

The reduction is pure residue-field algebra.  At a node (multiplicative reduction) `Δ̃ = 0` with
`c̃₄ ≠ 0`, so Mathlib's invariant relation gives `c̃₆² = c̃₄³`
(`HasMultiplicativeReduction.reduction_c₆_sq_eq`, #495).  Hence
`c̃₄ = c̃₆² / c̃₄² = (c̃₆ · c̃₄⁻¹)²` is a **nonzero square**, and since `−c̃₄ · c̃₆ = c̃₄ · (−c̃₆)`,
multiplying by the nonzero square `c̃₄` preserves squareness:
`IsSquare (−c̃₄ · c̃₆) ↔ IsSquare (−c̃₆)`.

Like its `c₄ · c₆` parent this is fully unconditional apart from the residue-characteristic
hypothesis; no Tate-curve / valuation-extension / base-change theory.  (The residue characteristic
`2` case is the Artin–Schreier split criterion, Mathlib's remaining open `TODO`, and is out of
scope.)

## Main results

For `W : WeierstrassCurve K` with `[IsMinimal R W]` and `[NeZero (2 : ResidueField R)]`, in
`namespace WeierstrassCurve`:

* `hasSplitMultiplicativeReduction_iff_isSquare_neg_c₆` — `W` has split multiplicative reduction iff
  `W` has multiplicative reduction and `−c̃₆` is a square in the residue field.
