# The sharp good-reduction valuation of `j`: `v(j) = v(c₄)³` (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be elliptic (`[W.IsElliptic]`) with good reduction over `R`
(`[HasGoodReduction R W]`). This file records the **good-reduction extreme** of the reduction-type ↔
`v(j)` dictionary (Silverman AEC VII.5.1) at full sharpness, mirroring the merged
multiplicative-reduction identity `valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction`
(`v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹`, `JInvariantReductionType.lean`).

Everything here is fully **ungated**: only the DVR multiplicative-valuation API, the already-merged
factorisation `valuation_j_eq_of_isElliptic` (`v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ · (v c₄)³`) and the definitional
`HasGoodReduction.goodReduction` (`v(Δ) = 1`). No valuation-extension, Tate-curve or normality
infrastructure.

## Key point

For good reduction `HasGoodReduction.goodReduction` records exactly `v(Δ) = 1` (the discriminant is
a unit). Feeding this into `v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ · (v c₄)³` collapses the discriminant factor and leaves
the sharp `v(j) = (v c₄)³`. This refines `isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction` (which only records
`v(j) ≥ 0`) to an exact value, and — since the value group `ℤᵐ⁰` is a linearly ordered commutative
group with zero on which `x ↦ x³` is strictly monotone, hence injective — yields the classical unit
criterion: under good reduction `j` is a unit exactly when `c₄` is,
i.e. `v(j) = 1 ↔ v(c₄) = 1`.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_j_of_hasGoodReduction` — the sharp identity `v(j) = v(c₄)³` under good
  reduction (strengthening `isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction`, which only records `v(j) ≥ 0`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_j_eq_one_iff_valuation_c₄_eq_one` — the unit criterion
  `v(j) = 1 ↔ v(c₄) = 1`: under good reduction the `j`-invariant is a unit if and only if `c₄` is.
