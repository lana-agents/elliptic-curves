# Multiplicative reduction makes the `j`-invariant non-integral (issue #72)

Let `R` be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field `K = Frac R`, and let
`W : WeierstrassCurve K` be elliptic (`[W.IsElliptic]`). This file records the
**multiplicative-reduction half** of the reduction-type ↔ `v(j)` dictionary (Silverman AEC
VII.5.1): a curve with multiplicative reduction has a **non-integral** `j`-invariant,
`v(j) < 0`. This is the opposite extreme to the good-reduction brick
`isIntegral_j_of_hasGoodReduction` (`JInvariantGoodReduction.lean`, #483), which shows good
reduction forces `v(j) ≥ 0`.

## Key point

Writing `j = Δ'⁻¹ · c₄³` and pushing through the (multiplicative) valuation `valuation K
(maximalIdeal R)` gives `v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ · (v c₄)³`. For multiplicative reduction Mathlib's
`HasMultiplicativeReduction` records exactly `v(c₄) = 1` (a unit) and `v(Δ) < 1` (positive
additive valuation). Since `[W.IsElliptic]` makes `Δ` a unit, hence nonzero, `v Δ ≠ 0`, so
`v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ > 1` — i.e. `j` lies outside `R`. This is the easy direction of the classical
statement that multiplicative reduction is detected by `v(j) < 0`; the converse (`v(j) < 0`
implies *potential* multiplicative reduction, the Tate curve) needs infrastructure absent from
both the repository and Mathlib and is left to a follow-on.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.valuation_j_eq_of_isElliptic` — the valuation identity
  `v(j) = (v Δ)⁻¹ · (v c₄)³` for any elliptic `W`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.one_lt_valuation_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` — multiplicative reduction
  implies `1 < v(j)` (multiplicative-valuation convention for `v(j) < 0`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.not_isIntegral_j_of_hasMultiplicativeReduction` — the `j`-invariant of a curve
  with multiplicative reduction is **not** integral: `¬ ∃ r : R, algebraMap R K r = W.j`.
