# The translation-by-a-point pullback on the function field of a Weierstrass curve

Let `W` be a Weierstrass curve over a field `F`, with affine coordinate ring
`F[W] = AdjoinRoot W.polynomial` and function field `F(W) = Frac F[W]`. For a fixed affine point
`T = (x₂, y₂)` on `W` (`h₂ : W.Equation x₂ y₂`), the translation map `P ↦ P + T` is a morphism of
the curve, and pulling back rational functions along it gives an `F`-algebra endomorphism of `F(W)`.
This file builds the *coordinate-ring half* of that pullback: the ring homomorphism

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateCoordHom h₂ : F[W] →+* F(W)`

sending the generic point `P = (x, y)` to `P + T`, i.e. realising on the coordinate generators

* `x ↦ addX x x₂ (slope x x₂ y y₂)` and
* `y ↦ addY x x₂ y (slope x x₂ y y₂)`

using Mathlib's affine chord-and-tangent addition formulae over the base-changed curve
`W ⁄ F(W)`. This is the second substrate consumed by a divisor-theoretic Weil pairing (the pairing
`e_n(S, T) = g_S(X + T) / g_S(X)` has `g_S ∘ (· + T)` as its numerator), and is a peer of the
multiplication-by-`n` pullback `[n]∗`.

## The construction

`W.CoordinateRing = AdjoinRoot W.polynomial` has base ring `F[X]`, so `AdjoinRoot.lift` needs
a ring hom `i : F[X] →+* F(W)` (the image of the `X`-variable), the image of the root `Y`, and a
proof of the single obligation `W.polynomial.eval₂ i (root image) = 0`. We take `i` and the root
image to be the `x`- and `y`-coordinates of `P + T`, and discharge the obligation by

* the **generic point on the curve** `equation_gen` — that the coordinate generators `(genX, genY)`
  satisfy the Weierstrass equation over `F(W)` (a transport of `AdjoinRoot.eval₂_root` through the
  bivariate evaluation bridge `Polynomial.eval₂_eval₂RingHom_apply`);
* Mathlib's on-curve **addition identity** `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equation_add`, applied over the
  base-changed curve `W ⁄ F(W)` to the generic point and to `T` (transported by `Equation.map`);
* the **genericity** `genX_ne` — that the generic `x`-coordinate is not the constant `x₂`, so the
  secant slope is the applicable branch.

## Main definitions and statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.genX` / `genY`: the coordinate generators of `F(W)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.equation_gen`: the generic point lies on `W ⁄ F(W)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.genX_ne`: genericity of the `x`-coordinate.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateCoordHom`: the translation pullback
  `F[W] →+* F(W)`, with generator images `translateCoordHom_X` and `translateCoordHom_root`.

## The endomorphism is built elsewhere, and the route predicted here was not taken

⚠️ **This section used to be headed `## Remaining work`** and to read:

> Extending `translateCoordHom : F[W] →+* F(W)` to the full endomorphism `F(W) →+* F(W)` needs
> `Function.Injective (translateCoordHom h₂)` (so that `IsFractionRing.lift` applies) — i.e. that
> the translation map is *dominant*. This is true because `T` is defined over `F`, so `P ↦ P + T`
> is an `F`-automorphism of the curve with inverse `P ↦ P + (-T)`; the clean route is to build the
> pullback along `-T` and compose. That is deferred to a follow-up (it requires the
> coordinate-level identity `(P + T) + (-T) = P`).

The extension is `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateEndo`
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.TranslationEndomorphism`), off `translateCoordHom_injective`.

⚠️ **The predicted route was not taken, and the difference is worth keeping.**  No pullback along
`-T` is ever built, and nothing is composed.  The cancellation `(P + T) + (-T) = P` is used
*inside the dominance argument* instead: `genX_mem_algebraicClosure_of` (again
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.TranslationEndomorphism`) evaluates it at the generic
point to conclude that if the translated coordinates are algebraic over `F` then so is `genX`,
contradicting `transcendental_genX`; injectivity then comes from the kernel being a maximal ideal
of the one-dimensional domain `F[W]` and Zariski's lemma.  A `-T` pullback would have been a second
`AdjoinRoot.lift` with its own on-curve obligation; the identity turned out to be needed only as a
group relation.  The composition-with-`-T` statement does exist, but one layer higher and for a
different purpose — `translateEndo_comp_zero`
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.TranslationAutomorphism`), which upgrades the already-built
endomorphism to an `AlgEquiv`.

The reusable crux — the generic point on the curve and the on-curve identity for `P + T` — is what
this file establishes.
