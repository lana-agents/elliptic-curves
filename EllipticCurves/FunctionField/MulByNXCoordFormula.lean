# `x(n • 𝒫) = Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)` at the generic point, and the first of the three degree gates

`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNDegreeTower` reduces `[F(W) : [n]∗F(W)] = n²` at general `n` to
three gates, of which the first is

> `nMulRatFunc W n = ΦDivΨSq W n` — the `x`-coordinate of `n • 𝒫`, produced by the group law, is the
> *written-down* fraction `Φₙ/ΨSqₙ`.

This file discharges that gate at every index `n` with `(n : F) ≠ 0`, over any field of
characteristic `≠ 2`.  **The two remaining gates are `#1184`'s coprimality and `(n : F) ≠ 0`
itself.**

⚠️ **Both have since been settled, and neither here.**  `#1184`'s coprimality holds at every
`n : ℤ` for an elliptic curve over a field of characteristic `≠ 2`
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent`, `EllipticCurves.Torsion.CoprimeAdjacent`), and
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNDegreeGeneral` composes it with the last theorem below to give
`[F(W) : [n]∗F(W)] = n²` with no unsupplied hypothesis.  ⚠️ Those two modules are **downstream**
of this one and not in its import closure; nothing below changed, and the hypothesis-carrying forms
are still the right shape here.

## Where it comes from: one merged theorem, applied over the wrong field on purpose

`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.hasXCoordFormula_of_two_ne_zero`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulOrder`) is `HasXCoordFormula W n` at **every** index over **any**
field of characteristic `≠ 2`.  It is a statement about points of a curve over a field, and the
generic point `𝒫 = (genX W, genY W)` is a point of the curve `W ⁄ F(W)` over the field `F(W)`.  So
it applies there, with `F := F(W)` and `W := W.map (algebraMap F F(W))`, and no descent, no
specialisation and no function-field machinery is involved.

⚠️ **That is the whole content of the coordinate formula below.**  It is short because the work was
done at the level of points; what is new is only the observation that the generic point is a point.
The transcendence section below is a second, separate argument.

Its one hypothesis, `ΨSqₙ` not vanishing at `genX`, is `eval_ΨSq_genX_ne_zero` below: `genX` is
transcendental over `F` (`transcendental_genX`) and `ΨSqₙ` is a nonzero polynomial when
`(n : F) ≠ 0` (Mathlib's `ΨSq_ne_zero`), and a nonzero polynomial does not vanish at a
transcendental element.

## The transcendence hypothesis, discharged without an algebraic closure

`mulByNEndo n` exists only given `Transcendental F (n • 𝒫).xCoord`.  On `main` that is discharged
by `transcendental_xCoord_nsmul_of_isAlgClosed` (`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNTranscendence`)
under `[IsAlgClosed F]`, `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `n ≠ 0`.  With the coordinate formula in hand the
dominance argument of `isAlgebraic_genX_of_two`
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByTwoEndomorphism`) runs verbatim at general `n`:
`Φₙ` has degree `n²` with leading coefficient `1` while `natDegree ΨSqₙ ≤ n² − 1`, so
`Φₙ − t·ΨSqₙ` is a nonzero polynomial annihilating `genX` over the relative algebraic closure.

⚠️ The two readings are **incomparable, not nested**: this one asks `(n : F) ≠ 0` and no closure,
the merged one asks a closure and only `n ≠ 0`.  Over an algebraically closed field of
characteristic `p` with `p ∣ n`, the merged one applies and this one does not.  Neither supersedes
the other and the merged statement is untouched.

## ⚠️ What this file does *not* do

* **It does not prove `[F(W) : [n]∗F(W)] = n²` unconditionally.**  `#1184` —
  `IsCoprime (ΨSq (n+1) · ΨSq (n−1)) (ΨSqₙ)` at general `n` — is untouched *here*, and
  `finrank_mulByNFieldRange_eq_sq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent` below carries it as a hypothesis.  What
  changes is that `#1184` and `(n : F) ≠ 0` are the **only** two hypotheses between this tree
  and the general-`n` degree; before, `#251` stood beside them.  ⚠️ The first of the two was
  discharged afterwards, in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.CoprimeAdjacent`, and the composition is
  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNDegreeGeneral` — both downstream of this file.
* **It says nothing about `#E[n] = n²`.**  The counting step — a separable isogeny has as many
  points in its kernel as its degree — is in this tree at no index, as
  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByTwoDegree`'s scope section records.  A field degree is not a
  point count.
* **It does not identify the two `[n]∗`s.**  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNPullback`'s
  `mulByNEndo` is built from the group law, and `#405`'s *second*, division-polynomial `[n]∗` is not
  built here; what is proved is that the two constructions agree on `genX`, which is the `x`-half of
  that identification and the only half a degree count consumes.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.eval_ΨSq_genX_ne_zero` : `ΨSqₙ(genX) ≠ 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.xCoord_nsmul_genericPoint` : **the coordinate formula at
  the generic point**, `x(n • 𝒫) = Φₙ(genX)/ΨSqₙ(genX)`, at every index with `(n : F) ≠ 0`.
* `…CoordinateRing.transcendental_xCoord_nsmul_genericPoint_of_intCast_ne_zero` : the transcendence
  hypothesis, with no algebraic closure.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.nMulRatFunc_eq_ΦDivΨSq` : **gate 1**, discharged.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.finrank_mulByNFieldRange_eq_sq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent`:
  `[F(W) : [n]∗F(W)] = n²`, with `#1184` as its only remaining mathematical hypothesis.

algebraic closure of `F`.

The dominance argument of `isAlgebraic_genX_of_two`
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByTwoEndomorphism`) at general `n`: if `u := x(n • 𝒫)` were
algebraic over `F` then `genX` would be a root of `q := Φₙ − u·ΨSqₙ` over the relative algebraic
closure `K`, and `q ≠ 0` because its coefficient in degree `n²` is `1` — Mathlib's `coeff_Φ` gives
`Φₙ` leading coefficient `1` there, and `natDegree_ΨSq_le` puts `ΨSqₙ` strictly below it.  That
contradicts `transcendental_genX`.

⚠️ `n ≠ 0` is what makes `n² − 1 < n²`, and it comes from `hn`; at `n = 0` the two degrees are both
`0` and the argument has nothing to say.

⚠️ **This does not supersede `transcendental_xCoord_nsmul_of_isAlgClosed`**
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNTranscendence`), and is not superseded by it: that one asks
`[IsAlgClosed F]` and `n ≠ 0`, this one asks `(n : F) ≠ 0` and no closure.  Over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic `p` with `p ∣ n` only the merged one applies. -/
