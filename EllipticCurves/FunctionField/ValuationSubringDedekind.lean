# Valuation subrings of the fraction field of a Dedekind domain

Let `R` be a Dedekind domain with fraction field `K`.  Mathlib attaches to every height-one prime
`v` of `R` the valuation subring `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuationSubringAtPrime K v`
— the localisation `R_v`, sitting inside `K` — and identifies it with the valuation subring of the
`v`-adic valuation.  This file proves the **converse**: those are *all* the valuation subrings of
`K` that contain `R`, apart from `K` itself.

```
IsDedekindDomain.exists_valuationSubringAtPrime_eq :
  (∀ r : R, algebraMap R K r ∈ O) → O ≠ ⊤ → ∃ v, valuationSubringAtPrime K v = O
```

Classically this is the statement that the places of `K` lying over the primes of `R` are exactly
the localisations of `R`, and it is the engine of the classification of the places of a function
field (Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, I.1.5–I.2.2).  The classical proof
argues that a discrete valuation ring is a *maximal* proper subring of its fraction field;
Mathlib's `ValuationSubring.eq_of_le_of_ne_top`, available under `[Ring.KrullDimLE 1 A]`, is that
statement, and `valuationSubringAtPrime` already carries the `Ring.KrullDimLE 1` instance.  So the
work here is only to produce the prime, which is the contraction of the maximal ideal of `O`.

## Main results

* `ValuationSubring.maximalIdeal_ne_bot` — a proper valuation subring of a field has a nonzero
  maximal ideal (equivalently: it is not a field);
* `ValuationSubring.mul_mem_nonunits` — the nonunits of `O`, viewed inside `K`, absorb
  multiplication by `O`;
* **`IsDedekindDomain.exists_valuationSubringAtPrime_eq`** — the classification above;
* `IsDedekindDomain.exists_valuationSubring_eq` — the same, phrased with
  `(v.valuation K).valuationSubring`;
* `IsDedekindDomain.exists_valuationSubringAtPrime_eq_iff` — the two hypotheses are not merely
  sufficient but *characterise* the valuation subrings of this form, via the converse lemmas
  `HeightOneSpectrum.algebraMap_mem_valuationSubringAtPrime` and
  `HeightOneSpectrum.valuationSubringAtPrime_ne_top`;
* **`HeightOneSpectrum.valuationSubringAtPrime_injective`** — `v ↦ R_v` is injective, so with the
  previous result it is a *bijection* from the height-one primes of `R` onto the proper valuation
  subrings of `K` containing `R`.  The prime is recovered from the subring by
  `HeightOneSpectrum.mem_asIdeal_iff_mem_nonunits`.

Nothing in this file mentions elliptic curves; it is an upstream candidate, and sits next to
`Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/AdicValuation.lean`.

## Implementation notes

`ValuationSubring K` is the formalisation of "place of `K`" used throughout this development: a
ring automorphism of `K` carries valuation subrings to valuation subrings, which is exactly what a
classification of places is for, and it avoids quantifying over value groups.

/-- **Every proper valuation subring of `K` containing a Dedekind domain `R` with `Frac R = K` is
the localisation of `R` at a height-one prime.**

The prime is the contraction to `R` of the maximal ideal of `O`; it is nonzero because clearing the
denominator of a nonzero element of that maximal ideal produces a nonzero element of `R` inside it.
Once `R_v ≤ O` is known, `ValuationSubring.eq_of_le_of_ne_top` upgrades it to equality, since `R_v`
has Krull dimension at most one. -/
