# Descent of integral closedness along a faithfully flat extension

This file proves that **integral closedness descends along a faithfully flat algebra of domains**:

* `IsIntegrallyClosed.of_faithfullyFlat` : if `B` is a faithfully flat `A`-algebra, both `A` and `B`
  are domains, and `B` is integrally closed, then `A` is integrally closed.

This is a general commutative-algebra fact (no elliptic-curve content) and is a Mathlib-upstream
candidate. It is the ring-theoretic engine of the general-base-field normality of the affine
coordinate ring of a Weierstrass curve (issue #476, child A #477): with the algebraically-closed
case `isIntegrallyClosed_of_isAlgClosed` (`CoordinateRingNormalAlgClosed.lean`, PR #191) available,
this descends `IsIntegrallyClosed` from `F̄[W] = F[W] ⊗_F F̄` (faithfully flat over `F[W]`, as `F̄`
is free over `F`) down to `F[W]` for an arbitrary base field `F`.

## The mathematics

Work in the fraction fields `K = Frac A` and `L = Frac B`. Faithful flatness makes `algebraMap A B`
injective (`FaithfulSMul.algebraMap_injective`), so it lifts to an `A`-algebra hom `f : K →ₐ[A] L`.
Take `x ∈ K` integral over `A`; then `f x` is integral over `A`, hence over `B`, so by
`IsIntegrallyClosed B` we get `f x = algebraMap B L b` for some `b : B`. Writing `x = a / s`
(`a : A`, `s ∈ A⁰`) and comparing in `L` — where `algebraMap A L` factors through `algebraMap A B`
by the scalar tower — injectivity of `algebraMap B L` yields
`b · algebraMap A B s = algebraMap A B a` in `B`, i.e.
`algebraMap A B a ∈ (Ideal.span {s}).map (algebraMap A B)`. Faithful flatness contracts this ideal
(`Ideal.comap_map_eq_self_of_faithfullyFlat`), giving `a ∈ Ideal.span {s}`, i.e. `s ∣ a`. Hence
`x = a / s` is the image of the quotient and lies in `A`, so `A` is integrally closed.
