# The constant field of an elliptic curve function field

The keystone bridge (issue #434):  if the base change of a field extension `E / F` to the
algebraic closure `AlgebraicClosure F` is a domain, then `F` is relatively algebraically closed in
`E`, i.e. `algebraicClosure F E = ⊥`.

## Main results

* `algebraicClosure_eq_bot_of_isDomain_tensor` — the field-theoretic keystone: geometric
  integrality (`IsDomain (AlgebraicClosure F ⊗[F] E)`) forces `algebraicClosure F E = ⊥`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.algebraicClosure_functionField_eq_bot_of_isDomain_tensor` — the keystone
  specialised to the function field `F(W)` of a Weierstrass curve, delivering the exact `halg`
  hypothesis (`algebraicClosure F W.FunctionField = ⊥`) carried by `WeilPairingConstant.lean`
  (#162), conditional on the geometric-integrality datum
  `IsDomain (AlgebraicClosure F ⊗[F] W.FunctionField)`.

## The geometric-integrality hypothesis is discharged elsewhere — it is not open

⚠️ This section used to be headed *"Remaining for #434"* and to call the discharge of
`IsDomain (AlgebraicClosure F ⊗[F] W.FunctionField)` *"the remaining, heavier follow-on"*.  **It is
merged**, by exactly the route named here: `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isDomain_tensor_functionField`
(`EllipticCurves/FunctionField/ConstantFieldDomain.lean`) obtains it from
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.irreducible_polynomial` over the algebraically closed base — the
Weierstrass polynomial stays irreducible, so `F̄ ⊗ F[W]` is a domain and `F̄ ⊗ F(W)` is a
localisation of it — and it is registered as an **instance**, so the two results this file states
are available unconditionally there, as
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.algebraicClosure_functionField_eq_bot`.  The
`halg`-consuming lemmas of `WeilPairingConstant.lean` were made unconditional at the same time and
carry no residual constant-field hypothesis.

The conditional forms are kept here deliberately: they are the general field-theoretic statement
(`algebraicClosure_eq_bot_of_isDomain_tensor` is about an arbitrary extension `E / F`) and this file
must stay upstream of the tensor/localisation machinery that discharges the datum.

/-- **The keystone bridge.**  If the base change of `E / F` to `AlgebraicClosure F` is a domain,
then `F` is relatively algebraically closed in `E`: `algebraicClosure F E = ⊥`.

The proof takes an algebraic `z ∈ E`, forms the finite subextension `L := F⟮z⟯`, and base changes
to `F̄ := AlgebraicClosure F`.  The inclusion `L ↪ E` tensors (over the flat/free `F̄`) to an
injection `F̄ ⊗ L ↪ F̄ ⊗ E`, so `F̄ ⊗ L` is a domain.  Being finite over the algebraically closed
`F̄`, it is integral, hence `algebraMap F̄ (F̄ ⊗ L)` is bijective and `finrank F̄ (F̄ ⊗ L) = 1`.
Base change preserves finrank, so `finrank F L = 1`, forcing `L = ⊥` and `z ∈ F`. -/
