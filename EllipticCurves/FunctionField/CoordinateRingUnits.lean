# Units of the affine coordinate ring are the nonzero constants

Let `W` be a Weierstrass curve over a field `F`.  Its affine coordinate ring
`F[W] = WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing` is a rank-two free `F[X]`-module with basis
`{1, Y}`, so every element is `p • 1 + q • Y` for `p q : F[X]`, and there is an algebra norm
`N : F[W] → F[X]` whose degree is `max (2 · deg p) (2 · deg q + 3)` (Mathlib's
`degree_norm_smul_basis`).

Geometrically `F[W]` is the ring of functions regular away from the point at infinity, so a unit —
regular and non-vanishing on the affine chart, with a regular non-vanishing inverse — has empty
divisor and must be a constant.  This file proves that arithmetically from the degree formula:

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.exists_eq_algebraMap_of_isUnit` — every unit of `F[W]`
  is `algebraMap F F[W] c` for some `c : F`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.isUnit_iff_exists_eq_algebraMap` — the characterisation
  `IsUnit x ↔ ∃ c : F, c ≠ 0 ∧ x = algebraMap F F[W] c`.

If `x` is a unit then `N x` is a unit of `F[X]`, hence a nonzero constant, so `deg (N x) = 0`.
Writing `x = p • 1 + q • Y`, the degree formula reads `max (2 · deg p) (2 · deg q + 3) = 0`, which
forces `q = 0` (else the second term is `≥ 3`) and `deg p = 0`, i.e. `x = C c` for a nonzero
constant `c`.

This is **Ward- and normality-independent**: it uses only the free-module / norm structure of
`F[W]` over `F[X]`, needing just `[Field F]` (no `IsDedekindDomain`, no elliptic-net input, not even
`W.IsElliptic`).  It supplies the "the unit `u` is a constant" input (`huf`) of the
divisor-theoretic Weil-pairing element (issue #419).

/-- **The units of `F[W]` are the nonzero constants.**  Every unit `x` of the affine coordinate ring
is the image `algebraMap F F[W] c` of a scalar `c : F`.

The norm `N x ∈ F[X]` of a unit is a unit of `F[X]`, hence a nonzero constant with
`deg (N x) = 0`.  Writing `x = p • 1 + q • Y`, the degree formula
`deg (N x) = max (2 • deg p) (2 • deg q + 3)` (`degree_norm_smul_basis`) forces `q = 0` and
`deg p = 0`, so `x = C (p.coeff 0)` is a constant. -/
