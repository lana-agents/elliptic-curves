# The generic point as a `Point` over `F(W)`, and the translation correspondence

Let `W` be an elliptic curve over a field `F`.  Its affine function field `F(W)` is again a field,
so the base-changed curve `W ⁄ F(W) = W.map (algebraMap F F(W))` is an elliptic curve over `F(W)`
(`(W.map f).IsElliptic` is automatic), and the **generic point** `(genX W, genY W)` — which
satisfies the Weierstrass equation (`equation_gen`) — is a *nonsingular* affine point, hence an
element of the Mathlib group `(W ⁄ F(W)).Point`.

This file packages that group-theoretic view of `F(W)`:

* `nonsingular_gen`  — the generic point is nonsingular (`equation_iff_nonsingular` on the elliptic
  base-changed curve);
* `genericPoint`     — the generic point `𝒫 := (genX W, genY W)` as a `(W ⁄ F(W)).Point`;
* `translatePoint`   — a fixed `F`-point `T = (x₂, y₂)` (`h₂ : W.Equation x₂ y₂`) as the constant
  `(W ⁄ F(W)).Point` `𝒯 := (x₂, y₂)`;
* `genericPoint_add_translatePoint` — the **translation correspondence**: the translation
  endomorphism `translateEndo h₂` acts on the coordinate generators exactly as `+ 𝒯` in the group,
  i.e. `𝒫 + 𝒯 = (translateEndo h₂ (genX W), translateEndo h₂ (genY W))`.

## Why this is the foundation for the `hcomm` discharge (#419 / #433)

The rung-6 Weil-pairing element (`WeilPairing.lean`, #419) still carries the hypothesis
`hcomm : translateEndo h₂ ([n]∗ f) = [n]∗ f`, geometrically `[n](P + T) = [n]P` for an `n`-torsion
point `T`.  Reading `translateEndo` as `+ 𝒯` (this file) and `mulBy{Two,Three}Endo` as `[n]•`
(the follow-on doubling/tripling bridge, cf. #251), `hcomm` becomes the group identity
`[n]•(𝒫 + 𝒯) = [n]•𝒫 + [n]•𝒯 = [n]•𝒫` from `[n]•𝒯 = 0`.  Everything here is Ward- and
normality-independent: it needs only `[Field F] [W.IsElliptic]`, no `IsDedekindDomain` and no
elliptic-net machinery.

```

Since `genX W ≠ algebraMap F F(W) x₂` (`genX_ne`), the affine sum takes the secant branch
(`add_of_X_ne`), whose coordinates are the `addX`/`addY` of the addition law — which are precisely
`translateEndo_genX`/`translateEndo_genY`.  This is the group-theoretic reading of `translateEndo`
that the `hcomm` discharge of #419 consumes. -/
