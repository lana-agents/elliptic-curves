# A rational function is determined up to a unit by its divisor

Building on `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.Divisors` (the order-of-vanishing / divisor calculus on
the function field `F(W) = Frac F[W]` of a Weierstrass curve whose coordinate ring is a Dedekind
domain), this file proves the **well-definedness backbone** of the divisor-theoretic Weil pairing
(project issue #244): on `F(W)` a rational function is determined, up to a unit of the coordinate
ring `F[W]`, by its divisor.

Concretely, if two nonzero `f, g ∈ F(W)` have the same order of vanishing at every closed point
(`∀ v, ord v f = ord v g`, equivalently `divisor W f = divisor W g`), then `f = u • g` for some
unit `u : F[W]ˣ`. This is exactly what makes the generator `f_P` — produced by the rung-1
principal-ideal statement `XYIdeal'_pow_isPrincipal_of_torsion` (issue #401), with
`div f_P = n·(P) − n·(O)` — canonical up to scalar, as the pairing `e_n(S, T)` requires.

## Main results

* `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.eq_of_count_eq` : count-injectivity of **nonzero fractional
  ideals** over any Dedekind domain — if `count v I = count v J` for every height-one prime `v`,
  then `I = J`. (General; a Mathlib gap-filler, upstream candidate.)
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.spanSingleton_eq_of_ord_eq` : equal orders everywhere give equal
  principal fractional ideals `⟨f⟩ = ⟨g⟩`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_unit_of_ord_eq` / `exists_unit_of_divisor_eq` : two nonzero
  rational functions with the same orders (equivalently the same `divisor`) differ by a unit of
  `F[W]`.

## Design

Everything carries the explicit hypothesis `[IsDedekindDomain W.CoordinateRing]`, exactly as in
`Divisors.lean` / `DivisorClassGroup.lean`, decoupling the development from the Part A normality
discharge of issue #396. It is likewise independent of the elliptic-net (Ward) recurrence.
