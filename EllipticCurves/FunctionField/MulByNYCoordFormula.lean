# `y(n • 𝒫) = ωₙ/(2ψₙ³)` at the generic point — the `y`-half of the identification of the two `[n]∗`

`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNXCoordFormula` proves `x(n • 𝒫) = Φₙ(genX)/ΨSqₙ(genX)` at the
generic point and says, in its scope section, exactly what it leaves:

> **It does not identify the two `[n]∗`s.** … what is proved is that the two constructions agree on
> `genX`, which is the `x`-half of that identification and the only half a degree count consumes.

**This file supplies the other half**, and with it `#405`'s deliverable 3: the generic-point images
of *both* coordinate generators under `mulByNEndo` are the written-down division-polynomial
expressions.

## Why this is now a corollary, and was not when `#405` was written

`#405` marks its deliverable 3 *"NOT READY — this is `#251`, do not do it here"*, on the grounds
that `x(n • P) = Φₙ/ΨSqₙ` was available at `n = 2, 3` only.  That is no longer the state of the
tree, and **both** halves are merged:

* the `x`-half — `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.hasXCoordFormula_of_two_ne_zero`
  (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulOrder`), every index, over any field with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`;
* the `y`-half — `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nsmul_eq_some_omegaY_of_ΨSq_ne_zero`
  (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulYPeriodic`), every index, **under the same hypothesis**
  `ΨSqₙ(x) ≠ 0` the `x`-half asks.

Both are statements about points of a curve over a field, and the generic point `𝒫 = (genX, genY)`
is a point of the curve `W ⁄ F(W)` over the field `F(W)`.  So each applies there with `F := F(W)`
and `W := W ⁄ F(W)`, and — exactly as for the `x`-half — no descent, no specialisation and no
function-field machinery is involved.  ⚠️ **The content is in the merged theorems; what is new here
is only that the generic point is a point.**

## Main statements

⚠️ Every public declaration of this file is listed.

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.ψ_gen_ne_zero` : **`#405`'s deliverable 1** — `ψₙ` does
  not vanish at the generic point, at every index with `(n : F) ≠ 0`.  The general-`n` form of the
  merged `psiTwo_gen_ne`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.yCoord_nsmul_genericPoint` : `y(n • 𝒫) = ωₙ/(2ψₙ³)`,
  spelled through `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.omegaY`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.two_mul_ψ_pow_mul_yCoord_nsmul_genericPoint` : the same
  cleared of its denominator, so `ωₙ`'s numerator and the parity factor are visible.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.mulByNEndo_genY_eq_omegaY` and
  `…mulByNEndo_genX_eq_ΦDivΨSq` : the two generator images of `[n]∗` in division-polynomial form.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.mulByNEndo_eq_of_genX_genY` : **the identification** —
  any ring endomorphism of `F(W)` fixing `F` and carrying `genX`, `genY` to those two expressions
  *is* `mulByNEndo n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.yCoord_nsmul_genericPoint_five_y2EqX3AddOne` : the
  non-vacuity certificate, `y² = x³ + 1` over `ℚ` at `n = 5`.

## ⚠️ What this does NOT do, and one thing it makes unnecessary

* **It builds no second `[n]∗`.**  `#405`'s deliverable 2 proposes `divPolyCoordHom`/`divPolyEndo`
  via `AdjoinRoot.lift` from `equation_div_of_ψ_ne_zero`.  With both generator images now known,
  that construction would be a *duplicate definition of `mulByNEndo`* rather than a second object:
  `mulByNEndo_eq_of_genX_genY` says any such lift equals `mulByNEndo n`.  ⚠️ The hypothesis
  mismatch `#405` records is real and is why this is stated as it is — the division-polynomial
  description carries `(n : F) ≠ 0` (through `ΨSqₙ(genX) ≠ 0`) and `mulByNEndo` does not.
* **It says nothing about `#E[n] = n²`.**  A generator image is not a point count; that gate is
  `#1506` scope item 1.
* **`#1184`'s arbitrary-ring coprimality, `#962` and `#639` are untouched.**
* ⚠️ **It does not weaken any hypothesis of the merged degree tower.**
  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNDegreeGeneral` consumes the `x`-half only, and nothing here
  is in its import closure.

deliverable 1, and the general-`n` form of `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.psiTwo_gen_ne`
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByTwoPullback`).

⚠️ The route is **not** the one `#405` proposes.  That issue suggests going through
`AdjoinRoot.mk_ne_zero_of_natDegree_lt`, as the merged `n = 2` case does.  It is cheaper to go
through the square: `ψₙ(genX, genY)² = ΨSqₙ(genX)` (`ψ_sq_evalEval` at `equation_gen`), and
`ΨSqₙ(genX) ≠ 0` is the merged `eval_ΨSq_genX_ne_zero` — `genX` is transcendental and `ΨSqₙ` is a
nonzero polynomial when `(n : F) ≠ 0`.  ⚠️ So the hypothesis really is `(n : F) ≠ 0` and not
`n ≠ 0`, which is what `#405` predicted.  At `n = 2` the hypothesis is `psiTwo_gen_ne`'s in
`Int.cast` spelling and the conclusion is the same, so this **does** subsume the merged `n = 2`
case; that one is left in place because it runs on a different argument — the `Y`-degree bound
through `AdjoinRoot.mk_ne_zero_of_natDegree_lt` — and is what `MulByTwoPullback` consumes.

⚠️ This does **not** need `[W.IsElliptic]`: `equation_gen` and `eval_ΨSq_genX_ne_zero` do not. -/
