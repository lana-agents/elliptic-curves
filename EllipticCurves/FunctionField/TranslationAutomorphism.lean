# Translation by a point is an *automorphism* of the function field

For an elliptic curve `W` over a field `F` and an affine point `T = (x₂, y₂)` on `W`, the
translation pullback `translateEndo h₂ : F(W) →+* F(W)`
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.TranslationEndomorphism`) reads on the generic point as `+ 𝒯` in the
group `(W ⁄ F(W)).Point`.  This file shows it is **invertible**, with inverse the translation by
`-T`, and packages it as

```lean
translateAlgEquiv h₂ : W.FunctionField ≃ₐ[F] W.FunctionField.
```

## Why this is not already available

`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.TranslationComposition` proves the contravariant composition law

```lean
translateEndo_comp (hsum : translatePoint hP + translatePoint hQ = translatePoint hR) :
    (translateEndo hP).comp (translateEndo hQ) = translateEndo hR
```

but invertibility is the case `P ⊕ Q = O`, which **cannot be stated in that signature**: `hR` ranges
over affine points and `O` is not one.  That file's scope note says as much — *"The degenerate
corner `P ⊕ Q = O` (off the affine chart) is out of scope"*.  It is a hole in the indexing, not an
oversight, and it is filled here by a separate zero-sum composition law
(`translateEndo_comp_zero`).  The merged `translateEndo_comp` is left untouched: six `WeilPairing*`
files consume its signature.

## Why the `AlgEquiv` matters

A place of `F(W)` is formalised as a `ValuationSubring`, and what transports valuation subrings is a
ring *automorphism* of the field — an `→ₐ[F]` does not suffice.  So any statement of the form "`τ_T`
permutes the points of the projective curve" needs `τ_T` at this type.  The `→ₐ[F]` form
(`translateEndoAlgHom`, merged) is the strongest thing that existed before this file.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translatePoint_neg` — the constant point of `-T` is the
  negation of the constant point of `T`, hence `𝒯_T + 𝒯_{-T} = 0`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateEndo_comp_zero` — the composition law in the
  degenerate case `P ⊕ Q = O`: `translateEndo hP ∘ translateEndo hQ = id`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateEndo_bijective`;
* **`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateAlgEquiv`** — `τ_T` as an `F`-algebra
  automorphism of `F(W)`, with `translateAlgEquiv_apply` and `translateAlgEquiv_symm_apply`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.translateAlgEquiv_ne_one` and
  `…nontrivial_algEquiv_of_equation` — translation by an affine `T` is never the identity, so
  `Aut_F F(W)` is nontrivial whenever `W` has an affine `F`-point.  This is the non-vacuity
  certificate; note it is conditional on such a point existing, which is a condition on `F`.

## Scope

Nothing here mentions divisors, places, or `ProjPoint`.  The divisor pullback under translation
(`#465` deliverable 2) is a separate, still-gated statement; this file only supplies the type its
statement needs.

/-- **The composition law on the coordinate generators, degenerate case.**  For affine points `P`,
`Q` with `P ⊕ Q = O` (as the constant-point identity `𝒯_P + 𝒯_Q = 0` over `F(W)`), the two
translation pullbacks compose to the identity on the generic point's coordinates.

The proof is `translateEndo_comp_apply_gen` with `𝒯_R` replaced by `0`: reading
`(𝒫 + 𝒯_P) + 𝒯_Q` as a secant sum on one side (legitimate because
`translateEndo hP (genX W)` is transcendental over `F`, hence never the constant `xQ`) and as
`𝒫 + (𝒯_P + 𝒯_Q) = 𝒫 + 0 = 𝒫` on the other. -/

/-- **Translation by an affine point `T`, as an `F`-algebra automorphism of `F(W)`.**  The inverse
is translation by `-T`.

This is the type at which `τ_T` can act on the places of `F(W)`: a `ValuationSubring` is transported
by a ring *automorphism*, and the merged `translateEndoAlgHom` is only an `F(W) →ₐ[F] F(W)`. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity: `Aut_F F(W)` is not trivial -/

/-- **Translation by an affine point is never the identity automorphism.**

If it were, then `τ_T` would fix both coordinate generators, so
`genericPoint_add_translatePoint` would read `𝒫 + 𝒯_T = 𝒫`, forcing `𝒯_T = 0` — impossible, since
`𝒯_T` is a `Point.some`.  Note there is no `T = O` to exclude: `translateAlgEquiv` is indexed by an
`Equation`, so `T` is affine by construction.

Together with `nontrivial_algEquiv_of_equation` this is the certificate that a statement about how
`Aut_F F(W)` acts on the places of `F(W)` is not a statement about a one-element group — **provided
`W` has an affine `F`-point at all**, which is a condition on `F` and is not claimed here.  It holds
whenever `F` is algebraically closed with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_equation`, `EllipticCurves/Torsion/ThreeTorsionStructure.lean`);
that file is deliberately not imported, to keep this one a leaf of the translation subtree. -/
