# The alternating property at general `n` over an arbitrary field: the halving point descends

Silverman *AEC* III.8.1(b).  `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingAlternatingAssemblyN` proves
`e_n(T, T) = 1` at an arbitrary `n` over an arbitrary field, but carrying **two** hypotheses: the
`#418` datum `hprin`, and a halving point `P` with `[n]P = T`.  This file removes the second at
**every `n ≠ 0`**, exactly as
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingAlternatingBaseChange` removes it at `n = 2` and `n = 3`.
⚠️ It used to do so only at `3`-smooth `n`; the `_of_ne_zero` statements below are that restriction
lifted (`#1549` group 2), and the `3`-smooth forms are kept as independent routes.

`hprin` stays.  ⚠️ It is `#418`, it is an *existence* statement, and existence does not descend —
`WeilPairingAlternatingBaseChange`'s test, which this file does not weaken: **base change carries
conclusions down, not hypotheses up.**  The halving point is used to prove an *equality* in `F(W)`,
and equalities descend.

## What made this reachable, and what it cost

The `n = 2` descent (`translateEndo_eq_self_of_mul_algebraMap_sq_eq_of_baseChange`) needs three
things pushed along `functionFieldMap`: the nonsingularity of `T`, the telescoping relation, and
the `n`-th root relation.  At general `n` two of those had no transporter:

* the `n`-th root relation mentions `[n]∗`, and `FunctionFieldBaseChange` had only
  `functionFieldMap_mulByTwoEndo` and `functionFieldMap_mulByThreeEndo`;
* the telescoping relation is indexed by `i • T` for `T : W.Point`, and
  `functionFieldMap_translateEndo` is indexed by an **affine pair** — the interior factor at
  `i ≡ 0` translates by the point at infinity, which that lemma cannot express.

Both are supplied by `EllipticCurves.FunctionField.FunctionFieldBaseChangeN`
(`functionFieldMap_mulByNEndo` and `functionFieldMap_translatePointEndo`).  ⚠️ The second was
*not* on anyone's list: `#1333` predicted the telescope row would "vanish entirely" because gate A
produces `htel` upstairs.  It does — and that is precisely why `htel` has to be carried *down*,
which needs the `W.Point`-indexed intertwiner.  Producing a datum upstairs does not remove the
need to transport it; it only changes which direction it travels.

## ⚠️ Where the `3`-smoothness entered, and what each half of it cost to remove

`hfac` was consumed in exactly one place: `exists_nsmul_eq_of_smooth`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulSmoothSurjective`), the halving point over `F̄`.  The transcendence
over `F̄` is `transcendental_xCoord_nsmul_of_isAlgClosed`, general in `n ≠ 0`.  So the first index
these statements did not reach was `n = 5` **for the halving point** — and a general-`n`
`[n]`-surjectivity on `E(F̄)` lifts them all to every `n` with nothing else changing.

⚠️ **That surjectivity was never missing, and swapping it in is measured now (`#1549` group 2): it
costs nothing.**  `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionOrder`) is
`[n]`-surjectivity on `E(F̄)` at every `n ≠ 0` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, under the same instances
`exists_nsmul_eq_of_smooth` was already being called with at this file's one call site — so
`…_of_baseChange_of_ne_zero` and `…_of_hprin_n_of_baseChange_of_ne_zero` below are the two
statements above with `hfac` deleted and **no index condition, no `h3` and no instance** put in its
place.  ⚠️ This paragraph used to say the substitution was *unmeasured*; that is what changed, and
the `#251` an older version of it blamed had already been closed.

⚠️ In `…_of_smooth` below the transcendence over `F` is discharged too, by
`transcendental_xCoord_nsmul_of_smooth`, and *that* one genuinely needs `3`-smoothness and `h3`.
So the two uses of `hfac` in that statement have different reasons, and they come off at **different
prices**: the halving point for free, the transcendence for `((n : ℤ) : F) ≠ 0` — which is exactly
what `exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_ne_zero_of_baseChange` pays, and why that statement has
an index hypothesis while the two above it have none.

## Main statements

⚠️ **Every statement below takes `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, and every one but the last takes `n ≠ 0`** — the
last takes `((n : ℤ) : F) ≠ 0`, which gives it.  The two `translatePointEndo_…` forms take the
telescope `htel` and the `n`-th-power identity `hpow`; the four `exists_weilPairingElt_…` forms
take the nonsingular `n`-torsion `T` and `hprin`.  The non-constancy of `x([n]𝒫)` is a hypothesis
of both `translatePointEndo_…` forms and of the two whose names carry `_of_hprin_n`; the other two
discharge it, which is what their bullets say.

⚠️ **Where a bullet says nothing about hypotheses, read it against this register; where a bullet
counts them, the count is that bullet's own claim and no register makes it true.**  Naming some
without counting is neither, and sits under this register unchanged; reporting one *discharged* is a
gate-discharge claim, which `README.md` `### Gate-discharge claims` governs.  That is the house form
`#1647` decided (`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingAlternatingAssemblyN`, PR #658), and this
list is one of the reasons it had to be decided at all: it carries hypothesis counts of its own,
below.

⚠️ **It replaces a universal that this list had falsified before the universal was written.**
This register formerly closed *"The bullets give the conclusions and not the hypotheses"*
(`#1626`, PR #654), while the rows below saying *"are the whole hypothesis list"* had been on the
page since `#1611` (PR #641) and `#1619` (PR #643), and the ⚠️ block under them argues for them at
length.  ⚠️ **Those counts are not the defect and are untouched**: they are the form `README.md`
`### Module-block bullets` mandates, because *"A register says what a list omits.  It cannot make a
count true"* — so the universal is the sentence that had to go, and not the rows (`#1650`).

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translatePointEndo_eq_self_of_prod_eq_of_pow_eq_of_baseChange` — gate B
  (`WeilPairingAlternatingWorkhorseN`) with its halving-point hypothesis **removed, not relocated**,
  over an arbitrary field at `3`-smooth `n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_hprin_n_of_baseChange` —
  `e_n(T, T) = 1` over an arbitrary field, so that `h2`, `n ≠ 0`, `3`-smoothness, the
  transcendence, the nonsingular `n`-torsion `T` and `hprin` are the whole hypothesis list;
  `hprin` is the only gate.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_smooth_of_baseChange` — the same
  with the transcendence discharged as well, so that `h2`, `h3`, `n ≠ 0`, `3`-smoothness, the
  nonsingular `n`-torsion `T` and `hprin` are the whole hypothesis list.
  ⚠️ **Both of those two lists used to stop at `hprin`, naming neither `n ≠ 0` nor `T`, and the
  `n ≠ 0` was not the same omission twice.**  In the first it *is* derivable from what the bullet
  names — the transcendence is unsatisfiable at `n = 0`, where `(0 • 𝒫).xCoord` is `0` and hence
  algebraic — so that row sat under `README.md`'s derivability exemption, whose price is that
  *"the derivation is cited once in the module block"*, and no citation had been written.
  ⚠️ In the second there is no exemption to use and the claim was **false**: `hfac` is *vacuously*
  true at `n = 0` (`Nat.primeFactors 0 = ∅`) and neither `h2` nor `h3` says anything about the
  index, so `n ≠ 0` followed from nothing the bullet named — while the statement consumes it, in
  `transcendental_xCoord_nsmul_of_smooth h2 h3 hn0 hfac`.  Naming the hypothesis in both is
  cheaper than citing a derivation in one, and it leaves the two rows making the same kind of claim
  in the same register.  ⚠️ `T` is named rather than left to *"the setting"* (`README.md`
  `### Gate-discharge claims`) because that register carries claims about **gates** and says in
  terms that it *"is not a licence to say the signature is short"*; and, more simply, because both
  rows make a **count** claim, which `README.md` `### Module-block bullets` puts beyond the reach
  of any register at all — *"A register says what a list omits.  It cannot make a count true."*
  So *"the setting"* was never available to these two, whatever it turns out to cover.
  ⚠️ **That ground is deliberately independent of whether `h` is a data argument** of
  `pointClosedPoint h.left` (`#1631`, since ruled: it is): the clearance is a licence to omit a
  binder, not a bar on naming one, so a count naming all seven explicit propositional binders is
  true under either answer.  ⚠️ `EllipticCurves.Torsion.WronskianSeparable` stands on the **same**
  ground, and gives it first: its block reads *"Every bullet above names the whole explicit
  hypothesis list of the declaration it is about"*, then *"And that includes `h : W.Equation x y`"*
  — so it is a count that names the binder there too (`#1620`, PR #647).  ⚠️ **What differs is the
  second ground each block adds, not the kind of row.**  That file adds *"bullet 3 makes no
  gate-discharge claim at all"*, and that one is **not** available here: the row above for
  `exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_hprin_n_of_baseChange` ends *"`hprin` is the only gate"*,
  so it makes exactly such a claim.  A ground therefore does not transfer between two blocks
  merely because their rows agree in kind — read every claim the row itself makes, and which
  register can reach each of them follows.
  ⚠️ The **declaration headlines** of both statements were already compliant — each names
  `3`-smooth `n ≠ 0` — and are untouched.  It was only this block that was short of them, which is
  the layer `#1614` was filed on.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.translatePointEndo_eq_self_of_prod_eq_of_pow_eq_of_baseChange_of_ne_zero`
  and `…exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_hprin_n_of_baseChange_of_ne_zero` — the first two at
  **every** `n ≠ 0` (`#1549` group 2).  ⚠️ Despite the `_of_ne_zero` suffix,
  which marks the general layer on this front, neither takes `((n : ℤ) : F) ≠ 0`: they are the
  `3`-smooth forms with `hfac` deleted and nothing put in its place.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_ne_zero_of_baseChange` — the third
  at every `n` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `((n : ℤ) : F) ≠ 0`.  ⚠️ This one **does** take an index
  hypothesis, because it also discharges the transcendence over `F`; `h3` and `hfac` are both gone.
  The `_of_smooth` form is a corollary of it, compiled in the `example` beside it.

`Recovery` derives the merged `exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_hprin_two` and
`…_of_hprin_three` (`WeilPairingAlternatingBaseChange`) from the general form, verbatim.

## What is *not* here

* `hprin` (`#418`, `#962`).
* The `μ`-valued twins.  ⚠️ Deliberately: they are `#1334`'s re-scoped deliverable, together with
  the `μ` forms of the merged general-`n` assembly, and splitting them across two PRs would put two
  authors in the same three-line neighbourhood again.
* Nothing on the index axis.  ⚠️ This bullet used to read *"`n = 5` and beyond — the obstruction is
  the halving point"*; the halving point is `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero` now and `n = 5` is
  reached, by all three `_of_ne_zero` statements below.
* The divisor half of base change (`#692`).  Nothing here wants it: no statement below mentions
  `divisor` on the `F̄` side, and `hprin` is never transported.

/-! ### The same at every `n ≠ 0`

`hfac` is consumed in exactly one place in this file — `exists_nsmul_eq_of_smooth`, the halving
point over `F̄` — and `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionOrder`) is the same conclusion under the same instances at
**every** `n ≠ 0` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`.  The module docstring above recorded that substitution as
*"not measured"*.  It is measured now, and the answer is that it costs nothing: the two statements
below are the two above with `hfac` deleted and **no index condition put in its place**.

⚠️ The `[(W.map (algebraMap F K)).IsElliptic]` instance the surjectivity needs is the same one
`exists_nsmul_eq_of_smooth` was already using at this call site, so no instance is added either.

⚠️ Both `_of_smooth` routes are **kept**: `exists_nsmul_eq_of_smooth` halves by iterated `2`- and
`3`-descent and consumes no division polynomial, while `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero` runs
through the `ΨSq`-root dictionary.  The `example` below compiles the containment. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity at `n = 6`, over a field that is not algebraically closed — and at `n = 10`

⚠️ `hprin` is `#418` and cannot be discharged at any index, so it stays bound below.  What is
certified is that **every other hypothesis of the `3`-smooth headline is simultaneously satisfiable
over `ℚ`** at an index no merged statement reaches: the elliptic instance, `(2 : ℚ) ≠ 0`,
`(3 : ℚ) ≠ 0`, `n ≠ 0`, `3`-smoothness, an affine nonsingular `T`, and `T ∈ torsion 6`.  The halving
point is not in that list because the theorem produces it — which is the whole content of this file.

⚠️ `ℚ` is **not** algebraically closed (`rat_not_isAlgClosed'`), so neither the merged
`exists_weilPairingElt_self_eq_one_of_hprin_n_of_algClosed` nor `exists_nsmul_eq_of_smooth` applies
directly here.  That is what makes this a certificate for the descent rather than a restatement of
the algebraically closed corollary.

⚠️ The curve is `y² = x³ + 1`, **not** this subtree's default `y² = x³ − x`: on the default every
affine rational point is `2`-torsion, so there is no point of order `3` on it.  A certificate
resting on a false hypothesis proves nothing (`#916`), so `htors` is proved rather than assumed.

/-! #### And at `n = 10`, which no `_of_smooth` statement in this file can state

⚠️ **`n = 6` cannot falsify the general layer.**  `6 = 2 · 3` is `3`-smooth, so every certificate
above is equally a certificate for the `_of_smooth` headlines, and a *"general"* wrapper that
happened to be instantiable only at `{2, 3}`-indices would pass it.  `#1549`'s verification bar asks
for an index that is **even and not `3`-smooth**; `10 = 2 · 5` is the smallest.

The witness is the other rational point of small order on the same curve: `(−1, 0)` is `2`-torsion
on `y² = x³ + 1` (`y = negY y` forces `2y = 0`, and `x³ = −1` over `ℚ` forces `x = −1`), hence
`10`-torsion.  ⚠️ Write the factorisation as `10 = 2 * 5` and not `5 * 2`: `mul_nsmul` reads
`(m * n) • a = n • m • a`, so it is the *left* factor that gets applied first. -/
