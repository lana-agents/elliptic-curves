# Multiplication-by-`n` on a formal group

Let `F` be a one-dimensional formal group law over a commutative ring `R`, with group operation
`z₁ ⊕ z₂ = F(z₁, z₂)` on power series of zero constant coefficient.  This file constructs the
**multiplication-by-`n` power series** `[n](z)` (`n : ℕ`), the one-variable series representing the
map `z ↦ n • z`, defined by iterating the formal group addition:
`[0](z) = 0`, `[n+1](z) = F([n](z), z)`.

We prove:
* `constantCoeff ([n]) = 0` and the linear coefficient `coeff 1 ([n]) = (n : R)`
  (so `[n](z) = n·z + O(z²)`);
* when `(n : R)` is a unit, `[n]` has a two-sided compositional (substitution) inverse — the map
  `z ↦ [n](z)` is bijective on series of zero constant coefficient.

This is the invertibility input consumed by the group `Ê(𝔪)` of a formal group over a complete
local ring (Silverman AEC IV.3, VII.2.2): for `m` prime to the residue characteristic `p`, `(m : A)`
is a unit in the DVR `A`, so `[m]` is compositionally invertible, hence `[m] : Ê(𝔪) → Ê(𝔪)` is
bijective and `Ê(𝔪)` is uniquely `m`-divisible (no nontrivial prime-to-`p` torsion).  Only positive
`m` is needed there, so this ℕ-indexed series suffices.

⚠️ **The `ℤ`-extension has landed, and it did not need the hypothesis this file used to price it
against.**  This paragraph used to end *"; the extension to `m : ℤ` (via the additive inverse
series) is handled once the `AddCommGroup` structure on `FormalGroup.Point` is available."*  It is
`EllipticCurves.FormalGroup.MulByZ`, which has this file in its `EllipticCurves`-import closure:
`FormalGroup.mulByZ : ℤ → PowerSeries R` with `[-m](z) := i([m](z))` for `i = F.formalInv` — the
additive inverse series named above — together with `FormalGroup.zsmul_val_eq_mulByZ_subst` and
`FormalGroup.zsmul_eq_zero_iff_mulByZ_subst`.

⚠️ And the named precondition was **stronger than what the extension used**, which is the part worth
keeping: `AddCommGroup (F.Point σ)` carries `[F.IsComm]`, whereas `AddGroup (F.Point σ)` — which is
what `mulByZ` consumes, for its `zsmul` — is unconditional.  `MulByZ`'s own header says so.  So the
ℕ-indexing here was never a commutativity restriction, and this file's `EllipticCurves`-import
closure stays **0**: the pointer above is prose, not an import.

The compositional inverse is Mathlib's `PowerSeries.substInvOfIsUnit`, which needs exactly
`constantCoeff P = 0` and `IsUnit (P.coeff 1)`.
