# The outer-variable derivative on the double Laurent ring and its `pderivSnd` compatibility

Mathlib provides `LaurentSeries.derivative` (`= LaurentSeries.hasseDeriv 1`) as an `R`-linear map on
`R⸨X⸩ = HahnSeries ℤ R` with `(derivative R f).coeff n = (n + 1) • f.coeff (n + 1)`, but proves
**no** product rule for it.  This file supplies the missing calculus for the outer (`z₂`) grading of
the iterated Laurent ring `(R⸨X⸩)⸨X⸩ = HahnSeries ℤ (HahnSeries ℤ R)`, which is what the
invariant-differential invariance `(★)` of issue #315 needs on the explicit Laurent addition
formulas.

## Main results

* `LaurentSeries.coeff_derivative` : the coefficient formula `(derivative ℤ f).coeff n
  = (n + 1) • f.coeff (n + 1)` with `Ring.choose (n + 1) 1` simplified away.
* `LaurentSeries.derivative_mul` : the **product (Leibniz) rule**
  `derivative ℤ (f * g) = f * derivative ℤ g + derivative ℤ f * g` for `f g : R⸨X⸩`.
* `LaurentSeries.derivative_inverse` : the **quotient rule** for `Ring.inverse` of a unit `u`:
  `derivative ℤ (Ring.inverse u) = - Ring.inverse u * derivative ℤ u * Ring.inverse u`.
* `HahnSeries.embedDoubleLaurent_pderivSnd` (the headline compatibility): the writer
  `embedDoubleLaurent : MvPowerSeries (Fin 2) R → (R⸨X⸩)⸨X⸩` intertwines the `z₂`-partial derivative
  `MvPowerSeries.pderivSnd` with the outer Laurent derivative `LaurentSeries.derivative ℤ`:
  `embedDoubleLaurent (pderivSnd φ) = derivative ℤ (embedDoubleLaurent φ)`.

## ⚠️ One `@[simp]` attribute was removed here, and the lemma kept (`#1278`)

`derivative_C` carried `@[simp]`, and the default simp set **already proves it** — through
`HahnSeries.C_apply`, `derivative_apply`, `hasseDeriv_single`, `Ring.choose_one_right'` and
`map_zero`. Measured with Mathlib's `simpNF` environment linter, which had never been run on this
tree. The lemma is unchanged and still has four consumers outside this file; only the attribute
went.
