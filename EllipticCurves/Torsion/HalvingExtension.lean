# The halving extension of a `2`-torsion point is separable

Let `W` be an elliptic curve over a field `F` of characteristic `≠ 2` and let `S = (x₀, y₀)` be a
`2`-torsion point of `W` — equivalently, a point whose `x`-coordinate is a root of the `2`-torsion
cubic `Ψ₂Sq`.  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`'s `exists_nsmul_two_eq_some_of_root`
halves `S` as soon as the quartic `Φ₂ - C x₀ · Ψ₂Sq` has a root carrying a point of `W` above it.
This file builds a finite **separable** extension of `F` over which that happens, and draws the
`IsGalois` conclusion a descent argument consumes.

## ⚠️ The quartic is not separable, and that is why this is not `#1985` again

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionSplittingField` (`#1985`) settles the other input to the same
chain by proving `Ψ₂Sq` separable and taking a splitting field.  **That argument cannot be copied
here by substitution.**  Over an algebraic closure the roots of `Φ₂ - C x₀ · Ψ₂Sq` are the
`x`-coordinates of the four points `Q` with `2 • Q = S`; `Q` and `-Q` share an `x`-coordinate and
`-Q = Q ⊕ S`, because `S` is `2`-torsion, so four roots counted with multiplicity sit over at most
two distinct values and the quartic has a repeated root.  A route through
`Cubic.discr_ne_zero_iff_roots_nodup`'s quartic analogue, or through
`Polynomial.nodup_aroots_iff_of_splits` on the quartic, fails on a true statement.

## The mechanism: the quartic is a perfect square, and its square root is what to adjoin

⚠️ **The repeated root is not an obstruction, it is the method.**  Write `K := 4x₀² + b₂x₀ + b₄`.
Then, for any root `x₀` of `Ψ₂Sq` and away from characteristic `2`,

```
Φ₂ - C x₀ · Ψ₂Sq = (X² - C (2x₀) · X - C (K / 2))²        (`Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq`)
```

as an identity in `F[X]`.  The two inputs are `Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ = 0` and Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.b_relation` (`4b₈ = b₂b₆ - b₄²`); no hypothesis beyond `(2 : F) ≠ 0` is used and
the curve need not be elliptic for the identity itself.  The monic quadratic on the right is
`halvingX` below, and **adjoining a root of it is adjoining the `x`-coordinate of a halving**,
because a root of `halvingX` is a root of the quartic.

That quadratic is separable exactly when `Ψ₂Sq` is separable at `x₀`, and the reason is an
arithmetic coincidence worth naming:

```
discriminant (halvingX x₀) = (2x₀)² + 2K = (derivative Ψ₂Sq).eval x₀     (`discrim_halvingX`)
```

so `separable_halvingX` takes the hypothesis `W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` and reads it at `x₀` through
`Polynomial.eval_ne_zero_of_isCoprime` (`EllipticCurves.DivisionPolynomial.Coprime`).
⚠️ **`W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` is taken as a hypothesis and is not reproved here.**  It is exactly
`#1985`'s `separable_Ψ₂Sq`, whose branch is not merged at the time of writing; the `Nonvacuity`
section below discharges it over `ℚ` from an explicit Bézout certificate, so nothing in this file
waits on that branch.

The `y`-coordinate costs a second quadratic and is easier: `halvingY x` is the Weierstrass equation
read as a quadratic in `y`, and its discriminant is `Ψ₂Sq.eval x` (`discrim_halvingY`), which is
nonzero at a root of `halvingX` because `Φ₂` and `Ψ₂Sq` have no common root
(`eval_Φ_two_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq`) — that is `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_halvingX`, and it is the
statement *"a halving of a nonzero `2`-torsion point has order `4` and so is not itself
`2`-torsion"* in the form the polynomials see.

## The field

`halvingField W x₀` is the two-step tower: a splitting field `L₁` of `halvingX x₀` over `F`, then a
splitting field of the `y`-quadratic over `L₁`.  Each floor is a splitting field of a separable
quadratic, hence Galois, so the tower is finite and separable over `F`
(`isSeparable_halvingField`, `finiteDimensional_halvingField`).

⚠️ **Separable and finite is not Galois**, normality not being transitive, so the Galois statement
is made about the normal closure: `isGalois_normalClosure_halvingField`.  That step mentions no
curve, and it is not taken here: `EllipticCurves.Galois.NormalClosureSeparable` states it for an
arbitrary separable extension, records why `IsGalois.normalClosure` does not supply it at
this tree's pin, and this file's theorem is the corollary of it at the halving field.

## Main statements

**The hypotheses the bullets omit**, listed here rather than in each bullet and written out per
declaration.  *A root hypothesis* below means a hypothesis of the form `….eval … = 0` — of `Ψ₂Sq`,
or of either quadratic, over `F` or over an extension of it.  The five groups partition this file's
**36** public declarations except for two rows that sit outside them: `discrim_halvingX`, in the
note that closes the last group, and `Polynomial.separable_quadratic`, which takes no hypothesis
but its own discriminant one.

* `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, a root `hx₀ : W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ = 0`, and neither `W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` nor
  `[W.IsElliptic]`: `Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq` and `eval_Φ_two_eq_of_root_halvingX`.
* `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` and `hx₀`, and **not** `[W.IsElliptic]`:
  `separable_halvingX` and `isGalois_halvingXField`.
* `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `[W.IsElliptic]`, with `hx₀` where an `x₀` is named:
  `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_halvingX`, `Ψ₂Sq_eval_halvingXRoot_ne_zero`, `isGalois_halvingField`,
  `exists_nsmul_two_eq_some_of_roots` and `exists_nsmul_two_eq_halvingField` — the last two taking a
  `[DecidableEq _]` as well, which the `Point` group structure needs — and, with
  `W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` also, `isSeparable_halvingField` and `isGalois_normalClosure_halvingField`.
* A root hypothesis, and neither `(2 : F) ≠ 0` nor `[W.IsElliptic]` nor `W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable`:
  `eval_Ψ₂Sq_baseChange` (`hx₀` itself), `equation_of_eval_halvingY_eq_zero` (a root of the
  `y`-quadratic), `eval_halvingX_baseChange` and `eval_halvingY_baseChange` (a root of a quadratic
  over the lower field).
* ⚠️ **Neither `(2 : F) ≠ 0` nor `[W.IsElliptic]` nor a root hypothesis**: `halvingX`, `halvingY`,
  `halvingX_monic`, `halvingY_monic`, `degree_halvingX`, `degree_halvingY`, `discrim_halvingY`,
  `separable_halvingY` — whose `W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x ≠ 0` is the negation of a root hypothesis and not one
  — `map_halvingX`, `map_halvingY`, `halvingXField`, `halvingXRoot`, `eval_halvingXRoot`,
  `halvingYPoly`, `halvingField`, `halvingYRoot`, `eval_halvingYRoot`,
  `finiteDimensional_halvingXField` and `finiteDimensional_halvingField`.
  ⚠️ `discrim_halvingX` is in none of the five groups: it takes `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and **no** root
  hypothesis, the only public declaration here that does, because it is an identity at every `x₀`.

* `Polynomial.separable_quadratic`: a monic quadratic with nonzero discriminant is separable.  The
  only **public** declaration here that mentions no curve, and the only one in namespace
  `Polynomial`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.halvingX`: the monic quadratic whose roots are the `x`-coordinates of the
  halvings of the `2`-torsion point at `x₀`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq`: the quartic is its square;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.discrim_halvingX`: its discriminant is `(derivative Ψ₂Sq).eval x₀`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.separable_halvingX`: it is separable;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.halvingY` and `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.separable_halvingY`: the
  `y`-quadratic above an `x`, and its separability;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_nsmul_two_eq_some_of_roots`: a root of each quadratic halves the
  point;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.halvingXField` and `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.halvingField`: the two floors
  of the tower;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isGalois_halvingXField` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isGalois_halvingField`: each floor is Galois over the one below;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isSeparable_halvingField` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finiteDimensional_halvingField`: the tower is separable and finite
  over `F`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isGalois_normalClosure_halvingField`: its normal closure is Galois
  over `F`;
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_nsmul_two_eq_halvingField`: `S` is `2`-divisible over the tower.

## What is *not* here

* **A discharge of `hprin` over a general field.**  `#962` records that gate and this file supplies
  one of its ledger rows.  No statement below mentions a divisor, a place or a principal divisor,
  and the assembly of `#1985`, this file, Hilbert 90 and PR #757 is the row after this one.
* **A reproof of `#1985`.**  `W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` is a hypothesis everywhere it is used below and is
  never derived from the discriminant; `Cubic.discr_ne_zero_iff_roots_nodup` is **not used** — no
  proof below invokes it, and the only other mention of it in this file says just that the route
  through its quartic analogue fails — and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionSplittingField` is not
  imported.
* **`n = 3`.**  Every statement below is at `n = 2`: `Φ 2`, `Ψ₂Sq` and the two quadratics.  Nothing
  is stated at a general index and nothing here applies to
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeTorsionStructure`.
* **A halving of a point that is not `2`-torsion.**  `hx₀ : W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ = 0` is a hypothesis of
  the square identity and of everything downstream of it.  ⚠️ For an `S` outside `E[2]` the quartic
  is generically *separable* and the whole mechanism of this file is unnecessary there; that case is
  not stated, in either direction.
* **Characteristic `2`.**  `halvingX` divides by `2` and is junk there; every statement that uses it
  non-trivially carries `(2 : F) ≠ 0`.  Nothing below decides whether a halving extension is
  separable in characteristic `2`.
* **`IsGalois F (halvingField W x₀)` itself.**  It is `IsGalois` in two steps and the composite need
  not be normal; the normal closure is where the Galois statement is made.

## Non-vacuity

The `Nonvacuity` section certifies over `ℚ` on `EllipticCurves.Fixture.y2EqX3SubX` — `y² = x³ - x`,
the curve this tree names as having full rational `2`-torsion and **no rational halving of any of
it** — that the extension this file produces is a **proper** one: `halvingX 0` is `X² + 1`, which
has no rational root, so the halving `x`-coordinate is outside the image of `ℚ`.  It also discharges
`W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable` there from an explicit Bézout certificate, which is what makes the main theorems
of this file inhabited without `#1985`'s branch.  ⚠️ A curve whose `2`-torsion point is already
`2`-divisible over `ℚ` — `EllipticCurves.Fixture.y2EqX3Add4X` is one, its `halvingX 0` being
`X² - 4` — would leave everything below green and certify only the case in which the tower is `ℚ`
itself.
