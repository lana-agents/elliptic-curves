# The structure theorem `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²` along coprime factorisations

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.Coprime` proves that torsion decomposes along coprime factorisations,
`E[mn] ≃+ E[m] × E[n]` for `Nat.Coprime m n`. This file turns that decomposition into a gluing
principle for the **structure theorem** `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²` (Silverman, *AEC*, III.6, Corollary 6.4):

```
E[m] ≃+ (ℤ/mℤ)²  →  E[n] ≃+ (ℤ/nℤ)²  →  Nat.Coprime m n  →  E[mn] ≃+ (ℤ/mnℤ)²,
```

the point being that `ZMod (m * n) ≃+ ZMod m × ZMod n` by the Chinese remainder theorem, so the
four cyclic factors regroup.

Feeding in the two sharp cases already available — `#E[2] = 4`, `E[2] ≃+ (ℤ/2ℤ)²`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsion`) and `#E[3] = 9`, `E[3] ≃+ (ℤ/3ℤ)²`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeTorsionStructure`) — gives the first **composite** instance of the
structure theorem: for an elliptic curve over an algebraically closed field in which `2 ≠ 0` and
`3 ≠ 0`,

```
Nat.card (W.torsion 6) = 36        and        W.torsion 6 ≃+ ZMod 6 × ZMod 6.
```

Like everything it builds on, this is **independent of the elliptic-net recurrence and of the
multiplication-by-`n` coordinate formula `x(nP) = Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)`**.

## What this reduces

Together with `EllipticCurves.Torsion.Coprime` (exact gluing at coprime factors) and
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.Multiplicative` (the bound `#E[mn] ≤ #E[m] · #E[n]` in general), the
structure theorem for a general `n` is now reduced to **prime powers**. Those genuinely need
surjectivity of `[p]` on `E(F̄)`. ⚠️ Two clauses this paragraph used to carry about that are false
and are replaced. The first, *"which is not available"*, is false at `p = 2`
(`nsmul_two_surjective`, `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`) and at `p = 3`
(`nsmul_three_surjective`, `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingSurjective`).  ⚠️ **Its continuation —
*"it stands verbatim for every prime `p ≥ 5`, which still needs the general coordinate formula
`x(nP) = Φₙ/ΨSqₙ`"* — is false now too**: `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionOrder`) gives `[p]`-surjectivity at **every** nonzero index over
`F̄` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, and the coordinate formula it named is itself proved at every index
(`hasXCoordFormula_of_two_ne_zero`, `EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulOrder`).  ⚠️ **A third clause is
now false as well.**  It read *"what still stops the prime-power reduction from closing at `p ≥ 5`
is the count `#E[p] = p²`, not surjectivity"*; that count is `card_torsion_eq_sq_of_odd`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaChordSum`) at every odd index, so the prime-power reduction closes at
every odd `p` — see `EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTowerOdd`, which also settles `E[n] ≃+ (ℤ/nℤ)²`
at every odd `n` directly, without going through a factorisation at all.  What still holds is that
the gate list is `EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTower`'s and that this file does not re-measure it.
The
second, *"only the exponent-one cases `p = 2` and `p = 3` are known"*, is false at every exponent:
`nonempty_torsionTwoPow_addEquiv` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoPrimary`) and
`nonempty_torsionThreePow_addEquiv` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreePrimary`) give every `2 ^ k` and
every `3 ^ k`, and gluing them gives every `3`-smooth `n`
(`nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_zmod_sq_of_smooth`). The concrete result at `n = 6` below is one
instance of that.

⚠️ **In particular this file does *not* give `#E[4] = 16` or `#E[9] = 81`.** That sentence is about
*this file's contents*, not about the development, and it is still true: those counts live in
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoPrimary` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreePrimary`.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_zmod_sq_of_coprime`: the structure theorem
  glues along coprime factorisations.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_six`: `#E[6] = 36`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionSix_addEquiv`: `E[6] ≃+ ℤ/6ℤ × ℤ/6ℤ`.

/-! ## Gluing the structure theorem along a coprime factorisation -/

/-- **The structure theorem glues along coprime factorisations.** If `E[m] ≅ (ℤ/mℤ)²` and
`E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²` with `m` and `n` coprime, then `E[mn] ≅ (ℤ/mnℤ)²`.

The four cyclic factors regroup: `E[mn] ≃+ E[m] × E[n] ≃+ (ℤ/mℤ)² × (ℤ/nℤ)²`, then
`AddEquiv.prodProdProdComm` rearranges this to `(ℤ/mℤ × ℤ/nℤ)²`, and the Chinese remainder theorem
`ZMod.chineseRemainder` identifies each factor with `ℤ/mnℤ`.

This is the reusable form: it assembles `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²` for a general `n` out of its prime-power
factors. -/
