# The on-curve identity for the division-polynomial coordinates, at general `n`

Mathlib leaves the `y`-coordinate division polynomials `ωₙ` as a `TODO`, so there is no statement
on the current pin that the multiplication-by-`n` coordinates `(Φₙ/ΨSqₙ, ωₙ/ψₙ³)` lie on the curve
— the *on-curve identity* that the function-field pullback `[n]∗ : F(W) → F(W)` consumes.
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaTwo` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaThree` state it at `n = 2` and
`n = 3`; both now import this file and read off their theorems from the engine below.

This file separates that work into the part that depends on `n` and the part that does not, in
exactly the shape `EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulSurjective` uses for the surjectivity engine.

## The one index-dependent input

Everything reduces to a **single univariate polynomial identity** in `R[X]`, packaged as the
predicate `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq`:

```
preΩₙ² · (if Even n then 1 else Ψ₂Sq) =
  4Φₙ³ + b₂Φₙ²ΨSqₙ + 2b₄ΦₙΨSqₙ² + b₆ΨSqₙ³
```

with `preΩₙ = preΨₙ₊₂·preΨₙ₋₁² − preΨₙ₋₂·preΨₙ₊₁²` the univariate `y`-numerator of
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaDivisionPolynomial`.  It is the completed-square form of the
Weierstrass equation at the point `(Φₙ/ΨSqₙ, ωₙ/ψₙ³)`, with all denominators cleared.

### Why the parity factor is `if Even n then 1 else Ψ₂Sq`, and why the coordinates are `ωₙ/ψₙ³`

The factor is a **theorem of the imported file**, not a fudge fitted to a degree count.
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaDivisionPolynomial` proves `Ω_factor`,
`Ψₙ₊₂·Ψₙ₋₁² − Ψₙ₋₂·Ψₙ₊₁² = (if Even n then ψ₂ else ψ₂²)·C(preΩₙ)`, and `ψ_mul_Ω`,
`ψ₂ₙ·ψ₂ = ψₙ·Ωₙ`.  At a point `(x, y)` of `W` at which `ψ₂` does not vanish those combine, after
cancelling the common `ψ₂`, into `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_two_mul_evalEval`:

```
(if Even n then 1 else ψ₂(x, y)) · preΩₙ(x) = ψ₂ₙ(x, y) / ψₙ(x, y).
```

That is what earns this file's repeated claim that its coordinates are `(Φₙ/ΨSqₙ, ωₙ/ψₙ³)`: the
`y`-value of `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equation_of_hasPreΩSqAt` below is `ωₙ/ψₙ³` for `ωₙ` in the
classical normalisation

```
2ωₙ = ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ − (a₁Φₙ + a₃ψₙ²)·ψₙ
```

of [Silverman, AEC][silverman2009], Exercise 3.7.  The factor in `HasPreΩSq` is the **square** of
the one in that numerator, which is why it reads `Ψ₂Sq` there and `2y + a₁x + a₃` in the `y`-value.

⚠️ **The degree count is kept, and it is an independent check rather than the evidence.**  It is
what predicted the shape before any of this was in Lean: `preΩₙ` has degree `3n²/2` for even `n` but
only `(3n² − 3)/2` for odd `n`, the missing `3` being the degree of `Ψ₂Sq`.

⚠️ **`preΨ₄_sq` is literally this identity at `n = 2`**, and the `n = 3` case is literally the
same algebra that `tripling_equation` used to run inline.  Both are univariate `CommRing` facts
about `preΨ`, so both live in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaDivisionPolynomial`; the `n = 3` one is
`hasPreΩSqAt_three` below, and it is proved here exactly once.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq`: the identity above, as a predicate on the index `n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSqAt`: the same identity evaluated at a single `x`.  This is what the
  engine actually consumes, and it is the weaker of the two — see the note on `n = 3` below.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasΨSqDoubling`: **the same identity with `preΩ` eliminated**,
  `ΨSq₂ₙ = ΨSqₙ·(4Φₙ³ + b₂Φₙ²ΨSqₙ + 2b₄ΦₙΨSqₙ² + b₆ΨSqₙ³)` — see the section below.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_zero`, `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_one`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_two`: the polynomial identity at `n = 0`, `1`, `2`, over an arbitrary
  commutative ring and in every characteristic.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq.neg`: the identity is an even function of the index, so those three
  give `n ∈ {0, ±1, ±2}`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq.at`: the polynomial identity implies the evaluated one.  ⚠️ At a
  *single* `x` there is no way back, but from the evaluated identity at **every** point of an
  infinite integral domain there is: `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_of_forall_hasPreΩSqAt` in
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaCharZero`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.hasPreΩSqAt_three`: the evaluated identity at `n = 3`, over a field of
  characteristic `≠ 2`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equation_of_hasPreΩSqAt`: **the uniform half, written once.**  Given the
  identity at `n` and at the point's own `x`, the division-polynomial coordinates at `n` satisfy the
  Weierstrass equation, over any field of characteristic `≠ 2`, at any point of `W` with
  `ψₙ(x, y) ≠ 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equation_of_hasPreΩSq`: the same from the polynomial identity.
* `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_iff_hasΨSqDoubling`: over an integral domain at an index that is
  nonzero in the base, the crux is **equivalent** to `HasΨSqDoubling`.  Its two halves,
  `HasPreΩSq.hasΨSqDoubling` (unconditional) and `hasPreΩSq_of_hasΨSqDoubling`, are stated
  separately.

## The crux written in Mathlib's vocabulary alone

`HasPreΩSq` is stated in terms of `preΩ`, which is this project's construction and appears nowhere
in Mathlib.  `ΨSq_two_mul` of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaDivisionPolynomial` —
`ΨSq₂ₙ = ΨSqₙ·(preΩₙ²·(if Even n then 1 else Ψ₂Sq))` — supplies the parity-corrected `preΩₙ²` as a
ratio of Mathlib's own polynomials, and multiplying the crux through by `ΨSqₙ` therefore removes
`preΩ` from it entirely:

```
ΨSq₂ₙ = ΨSqₙ · (4Φₙ³ + b₂Φₙ²ΨSqₙ + 2b₄ΦₙΨSqₙ² + b₆ΨSqₙ³).
```

The bracket is `Ψ₂Sq = 4X³ + b₂X² + 2b₄X + b₆` homogenised at `(Φₙ, ΨSqₙ)`, so this says that the
duplication map's denominator, evaluated at the multiplication-by-`n` coordinates, is the
multiplication-by-`2n` denominator — **the denominator half of "duplication composes with
multiplication by `n`"**, which is a classical statement about a classical object.

⚠️ **It is exactly as hard as `HasPreΩSq` and no easier.**  `hasPreΩSq_iff_hasΨSqDoubling` is an
equivalence; nothing is discharged by it.  What it buys is that the open question is now stated in
symbols Mathlib defines, so it can be searched for, asked upstream, and recognised — none of which
is possible for a statement about `preΩ`.

## ⚠️ What this does and does not settle

**Nothing is proved here at any index that was not already available.**  The instances are `n = 0`
and `n = 1` (both immediate), `n = 2` (the merged `preΨ₄_sq`) and `n = 3` (the algebra that the
merged `tripling_equation` used to run inline).  What the file settles is **how much is needed at a
new index, and that it is exactly one univariate identity** — no bivariate work, no hypothesis on
`(n : F)`, no algebraically closed base, and no group-law input.  `HasPreΩSq` at general `n` **was**
the crux left in issue `#404`; it is proved, at every index and over every commutative ring, by
`WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq` of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaCrux`, whose only index-dependent
inputs are this file's `n = 1` and `n = 2` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaCharZero`'s `n = 3`.
⚠️ **`n = 1` and `n = 2` below are two of the three base cases of that proof** — the third is the
*polynomial* `hasPreΩSq_three`, which lives one file later, not the evaluated `n = 3` instance here
— **and `n = 0` is the `n = 0` branch of `hasPreΩSq` rather than a base case of the induction.  So
"nothing is proved here that was not already available" is unchanged, and none of the four
instances is decoration.**

⚠️ **`HasΨSqDoubling` proves nothing either.**  It is an equivalent phrasing of the same crux at the
same index, and the equivalence — not a one-way reduction — is the whole of what is claimed for it.
The reduction that does weaken the hypothesis is
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaCharZero`'s `hasPreΩSq_of_forall_hasΨSqDoubling_algClosed`, and even
that weakens the *hypothesis*, not the *statement*.

⚠️ **The `n = 3` instance here is the evaluated `hasPreΩSqAt_three`; the polynomial identity at
`n = 3` is `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_three` and lives in
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaCharZero`.**  It is derived from the evaluated one and adds no algebra;
the next section is why it had to be derived rather than proved here.

⚠️ **What proving `n = 3` in the polynomial form directly would have cost, and why that is a
measurement rather than a preference.**  The polynomial identity at `n = 3` is true over `ℤ` — it
needs no characteristic
hypothesis — but `4b₈ = b₂b₆ − b₄²` is not available as a substitution over an arbitrary ring, so
`ring1` must be run with the `aᵢ` as atoms.  Expanded that way each side of the `n = 3` identity has
**9903 monomials in six atoms**, and the two ways of putting that to `ring1` were both measured
here:

* in `R[X]` it **does** close — `3 m 38 s` for the module elaborated in isolation — but the same
  declaration was **killed by `lake build` with exit `137`, out of memory**, and a proof that only
  survives outside the build is not a proof this file can carry;
* restated as a plain `CommRing` auxiliary lemma, to drop the polynomial-ring overhead, `ring1` was
  still climbing through **10.5 GB resident** after 90 s and was killed by hand.

With `b₂, b₄, b₆` kept as atoms and `b₈` eliminated by division by `4` the same identity has
**545 monomials** and closes in seconds — which is exactly what `hasPreΩSqAt_three` does, and
exactly why it needs a field of characteristic `≠ 2`.  The remaining characteristic-free route, a
`linear_combination` against `b_relation`, needs a cofactor that was computed here by exact
division and has **275 monomials**: a hundred-line constant with no independent meaning.  None of
the three was worth taking; the engine assumes characteristic `≠ 2` regardless, so the evaluated
form loses nothing at the point of use.

⚠️ **All three of those routes attack the identity directly over the general ring, and that is why
the enumeration read as exhaustive when it was not.**  There is a fourth, and it is the one that
won: do not attack it over the general ring at all.  Prove the **evaluated** identity over a
characteristic-`0` field, where `4` is a unit and the 545-monomial form above is legal, and then
descend — `Polynomial.funext` over an infinite domain turns "at every point" into the polynomial
identity, and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaUniversal`'s base change carries that down to every
commutative ring.  That is `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_three`, and its entire proof is
`hasPreΩSqAt_three` fed through `WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_of_forall_hasPreΩSqAt_charZero`:
**zero new algebra, and the 9903-monomial expansion is never run.**  The measurements above stand
unchanged — they are what routes 1–3 cost — and the conclusion that none of the three is worth
taking stands too; what moved is that none of them has to be taken.  ⚠️ Expect the same blind spot
at `n = 4`: the question to ask first is not "how do I make `ring1` survive over `R`" but "what does
this identity cost where `2`, `3` and `4` are units".

⚠️ **This is an on-curve identity for the classical division-polynomial coordinates, not a statement
about `n • P`.**  Identifying `(Φₙ/ΨSqₙ, ωₙ/ψₙ³)` with the group-law multiple is a genuinely
separate step — it is what `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingCoords` and
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingCoords` do at `n = 2` and `n = 3`, and it is issue `#251` in
general.  The two `OmegaTwo`/`OmegaThree` docstrings make the same disclaimer and it is unchanged.

```

This is the completed-square form `(2Y + a₁X + a₃)² = 4X³ + b₂X² + 2b₄X + b₆` of the Weierstrass
equation, evaluated at the division-polynomial coordinates `X = Φₙ/ΨSqₙ` and `Y = ωₙ/ψₙ³` and
cleared of denominators.  The parity factor `if Even n then 1 else Ψ₂Sq` is the square of the one
in the `y`-numerator, which `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_two_mul_evalEval` identifies with `ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ`;
see the module docstring, where the degree count on `preΩₙ` is retained as an independent check.

/-! ### The crux with `preΩ` eliminated -/

/-- **The crux restated with no `preΩ` in it**: the `2n`-division denominator is the `n`-division
denominator times the duplication denominator at the `n`-division coordinates,

```
ΨSq₂ₙ = ΨSqₙ · (4Φₙ³ + b₂Φₙ²ΨSqₙ + 2b₄ΦₙΨSqₙ² + b₆ΨSqₙ³)   in R[X].
```

The bracket is the homogenisation of `Ψ₂Sq = 4X³ + b₂X² + 2b₄X + b₆` at `(Φₙ, ΨSqₙ)`, so the
identity says exactly that `x ↦ Φ₂(x)/Ψ₂Sq(x)` composed with `x ↦ Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)` has the same
denominator as `x ↦ Φ₂ₙ(x)/ΨSq₂ₙ(x)` — **the denominator half of "duplication composes with
multiplication by `n`"**.

⚠️ **Every symbol here is Mathlib's.**  `Φ`, `ΨSq` and `Ψ₂Sq` are
`Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/Basic.lean`'s; `preΩ`, `Ω` and `ω` do
not appear.  That is the point of the reformulation: `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq` states the same
mathematics in a vocabulary this project invented, and a statement in a private vocabulary cannot be
searched for upstream, asked about, or recognised as classical.  This one can.

⚠️ **It is a restatement, not a simplification.**  `hasPreΩSq_iff_hasΨSqDoubling` below is an
equivalence, so this is exactly as hard as `HasPreΩSq` and no easier; nothing about `#404`'s crux is
discharged by naming it.  What changes is what a prover is looking at. -/

/-- **`HasPreΩSq n` gives `HasΨSqDoubling n`, over an arbitrary `CommRing`.**  Multiply the crux by
`ΨSqₙ` and read the left-hand side off `ΨSq_two_mul`; the parity factor of `HasPreΩSq` is the one
`ΨSq_two_mul` supplies, which is why nothing is left over. -/

⚠️ `hn` is doing real work and is not a proof artefact that a better argument would remove.  At
`n = 0` the statement `HasΨSqDoubling 0` reads `0 = 0 * _` and carries no information whatever,
while `HasPreΩSq 0` reads `4 = 4` and is `hasPreΩSq_zero`; so the two are **not** equivalent at
`n = 0`, and no proof of this direction can cover it.  What is lost is only that index: the
conclusion there is already available unconditionally. -/

`(Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x), ωₙ(x, y)/ψₙ(x, y)³)` satisfies the Weierstrass equation, where the `n`-division
`y`-coordinate value is

```
ωₙ(x, y) = ((if Even n then 1 else 2y + a₁x + a₃)·preΩₙ(x) − ψₙ(x, y)·(a₁Φₙ(x) + a₃ΨSqₙ(x)))/2.
```

This is the uniform half of the on-curve identity, written once.  ⚠️ The `if Even n` in the
numerator is the same parity factor as in `HasPreΩSq`, and it is not cosmetic: for odd `n` the
"`ψ₂`-value" `2Y + a₁X + a₃` of the multiple carries a factor of `2y + a₁x + a₃`, whose square is
`Ψ₂Sq(x)`, and for even `n` it does not.  `doubling_equation` and `tripling_equation` are the
`n = 2` and `n = 3` cases, and are derived from this theorem in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaTwo`
and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaThree`; their statements stay where they are, since they are
