# Dedekind-domain pillars of the affine coordinate ring of a Weierstrass curve

For a Weierstrass curve `W` over a field `F`, its affine coordinate ring
`F[W] = AdjoinRoot W.polynomial` (Mathlib `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing`) is a rank-two
free module over `F[X]` with basis `{1, Y}`. This file records the *ring-theoretic* consequences of
that finiteness that are needed to build the divisor / order-of-vanishing calculus on `F(W)` (the
foundation for a divisor-theoretic Weil pairing, project issue #244): namely that `F[W]` satisfies
two of the three defining conditions of a Dedekind domain, and that the third reduces to a single
normality statement.

Recall (`Mathlib/RingTheory/DedekindDomain/Basic.lean`) that a domain is a **Dedekind domain**
iff it is

1. Noetherian,
2. of Krull dimension `≤ 1`, and
3. integrally closed in its fraction field.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.instModuleFinite` /
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.instModuleFree`: `F[W]` is a finite, free `F[X]`-module
  (from `Polynomial.Monic.finite_adjoinRoot`/`free_adjoinRoot` applied to `monic_polynomial`).
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.instIsNoetherianRing`: pillar 1 — `F[W]` is Noetherian,
  being module-finite over the Noetherian ring `F[X]`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.instDimensionLEOne`: pillar 2 — `F[W]` has Krull
  dimension `≤ 1`, being integral over the dimension-one ring `F[X]` (a PID).
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.isDedekindDomain`: pillar 3 supplies the rest —
  **assuming `F[W]` is integrally closed**, it is a Dedekind domain. This isolates the full
  Dedekind statement to exactly the integral-closedness (normality) of the coordinate ring.

## Integral closedness (normality) — discharged elsewhere, for elliptic `W`

The integrally-closed hypothesis of `isDedekindDomain` is *not* discharged here, and this file
still carries it as a typeclass assumption. ⚠️ **But it is no longer open.** For an elliptic curve
it is discharged over an **arbitrary** field, as a global instance, in
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.CoordinateRingNormalGeneral`, which is what every downstream consumer
in `FunctionField/` actually runs on; that module holds the account, and this section deliberately
does not restate it.

What remains genuinely open is only the gap between that hypothesis and this file's:
`[W.IsElliptic]` (`Δ` a unit) versus an arbitrary Weierstrass curve. Normality is equivalent to the
coordinate ring being **normal**, which for the coordinate ring of a curve is equivalent to the
curve being nonsingular, and the *direct* route from the pointwise nonsingularity API is still
unavailable —
Mathlib has no `RegularRing → IsIntegrallyClosed` (Serre R1+S2 / Auslander–Buchsbaum) result, no
integral-closedness criterion for `AdjoinRoot`, and no bridge from
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Nonsingular` to normality of the ring; the localization-at-each-maximal
ideal route via `IsIntegrallyClosed.of_localization_maximal` still needs DVR-at-each-closed-point
machinery that does not exist. ⚠️ That is a statement about *this* route, not about the result:
the elliptic case was closed by faithfully-flat descent from the algebraic closure instead, which
is a route this paragraph did not consider.

dimension-`≤ 1` conditions hold unconditionally (`instIsNoetherianRing`, `instDimensionLEOne`); the
integral-closedness (normality) hypothesis is the only remaining input, and is left as a typeclass
assumption here so that this pillar holds for an arbitrary Weierstrass curve. ⚠️ For an **elliptic**
curve it is not an assumption at all: it is a global instance over any field
(`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.CoordinateRingNormalGeneral`), so this theorem's hypothesis is
discharged automatically there.  See the module docstring. -/
