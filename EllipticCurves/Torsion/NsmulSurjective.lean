# Surjectivity of `[n]` on `E(F̄)` from the multiplication-by-`n` coordinate formula

Over an algebraically closed field with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, multiplication by `n` is surjective on the
points of an elliptic curve as soon as two index-dependent facts are available:

1. the coordinate formula `x(nP) = Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)`, packaged here as `HasXCoordFormula W n`, and
2. the pointwise statement that `Φₙ` and `ΨSqₙ` have no common root in `F`.

**Everything else is uniform in `n`** — the degree count on `Φₙ − x₀·ΨSqₙ`, the root extraction over
`F̄`, the choice of a point above the root, and the absorption of the sign ambiguity `nP = ±Q` — and
this file is that uniform half, written once.

## ⚠️ Where the algebraic closure enters, and the finite-level layer that does without it

`[IsAlgClosed F]` is used in exactly **two** places in this file, both inside
`exists_nsmul_some_of_hasXCoordFormula`: the root extraction `exists_eval_Φ_eq` and the point
above the root `exists_equation`.  Nothing else here, and nothing this file imports on its behalf,
needs a closed field.  Promoted to arguments they give
`exists_nsmul_some_of_hasXCoordFormula_of_root` and its named-point form, which hold over an
arbitrary field — and, because `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `n ≠ 0` are consumed *only* by those two uses, in
every characteristic and at every `n` as well.

⚠️ The two uses are **dependent**: the point is sought above the root the first one produced.  So
the finite-level form takes `x` and `y` as arguments rather than taking two independent
hypotheses — the naive "add a `Splits` hypothesis and an `IsSquare` hypothesis" shape does not
typecheck, because the second would have to mention a variable the first introduces.

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingSurjective`, which
**import this file**, supply the two inputs at `n = 2` and `n = 3` and obtain `nsmul_two_surjective`
and `nsmul_three_surjective` as one-line instances of `nsmul_surjective_of_hasXCoordFormula`.

## What this does and does not settle

⚠️ **Nothing is proved here at any index.**  This file contains no instance of either input; taken
alone its two headline theorems are conditional statements with no known witness.  The witnesses are
downstream, at `n = 2` and `n = 3` only.

What the file *does* settle is **how much is needed, and that it is exactly two things**.
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.CoprimeStructure` reduces the structure theorem `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²` to prime
powers and records that every prime `p ≥ 5` is blocked on `[p]`-surjectivity, "which still needs the
general coordinate formula".  That sentence remains true, and its subject now has names: what is
missing at a prime `p ≥ 5` is a term of `HasXCoordFormula W p` (issue `#251`) **and** a term of
`∀ x, (W.ΨSq p).eval x = 0 → (W.Φ p).eval x ≠ 0` (implied by issue `#1184`, and strictly weaker than
it).  Beyond those two, nothing — no degree hypothesis, no Bézout certificate, and no hypothesis on
`(n : F)`.

⚠️ So `#1184` is **not** only a gate under rung 3's degree count, which is where it is filed: a
weakening of it is also a gate under the structure theorem at every prime `p ≥ 5`.

⚠️ **The next sentence of this paragraph used to read *"The two instances that exist show the
weakening is the cheaper target — neither `n = 2` nor `n = 3` obtains it through Bézout"*, and its
second half is still exactly right while its first half has been answered and refuted.**  What was
measured is that at both available indices the pointwise input is obtained without a Bézout
certificate; what was inferred from it is that the pointwise statement is therefore the cheaper
target at general `n`.  It is not.  `eval_Φ_ne_zero_iff_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero`, in
`EllipticCurves.DivisionPolynomial.Coprime`, shows that at a root of `ΨSqₙ` the square of `Φₙ`
**is** the adjacent product `ΨSqₙ₊₁ · ΨSqₙ₋₁`.  So over a field the pointwise statement for
`(Φₙ, ΨSqₙ)` is *equivalent* to the pointwise statement for the adjacent pair, and the surviving
difficulty — that `ΨSqₙ` and its neighbours have no common root — is the same one `#1184` is left
with after `isCoprime_Φ_ΨSq_of_isCoprime_ΨSq_adjacent`.  The weakening drops the Bézout certificate
and nothing else.

⚠️ **Nothing about this file changes.**  Its input is still the pointwise statement, that is still
strictly weaker than `#1184`, and taking it in that form is still right — what is retired is only
the claim that the general target is cheaper *because* of it.  Neither module named above is in
this file's import closure and none is added; both directions were re-grepped when this paragraph
was written.

## Two economies of the `n = 2` and `n = 3` arguments are preserved deliberately

* **No hypothesis on `(n : F)`.**  The degree input is `natDegree_Φ (n : ℤ) = n.natAbs ^ 2` with
  leading coefficient `1`, against `natDegree_ΨSq_le (n : ℤ) ≤ n.natAbs ^ 2 - 1`; **both are
  unconditional in Mathlib**, so `n ≠ 0` alone gives `Φₙ − C x₀ · ΨSqₙ` degree `n²`.  Mathlib's
  sharp `natDegree_ΨSq` carries `(n : R) ≠ 0` and is *not* used.  `TriplingSurjective`'s docstring
  records that this is exactly what makes `nsmul_three_surjective` hold in characteristic `3`; the
  same economy survives at general `n`.
* **No Bézout certificate — in this file.**  Input (2) is taken in the weak pointwise form
  `∀ x, (ΨSqₙ).eval x = 0 → (Φₙ).eval x ≠ 0`, and nothing here asks for more.
  The full coprimality `IsCoprime (W.Φ n) (W.ΨSq n)` — issue `#1184`, proved in this tree only at
  `n = 2` and `n = 3` — is **strictly stronger** than what is used, and
  `eval_Φ_ne_zero_of_isCoprime` below is the one-line bridge that lets it be plugged in if it ever
  lands at general `n`.  ⚠️ It is a bridge and not a dependency: `#1184` is not in this file's
  import closure.

  ⚠️ **This bullet used to continue *"…which is what the two available instances establish
  directly — at `n = 2` through `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃` and at `n = 3` through
  `Φ_three_eval_ne_zero_of_Ψ₃`, neither of which needs a resultant or an identity
  `A·Φₙ + B·ΨSqₙ = Δ`"*, and that is no longer how the two instances are proved.**  Both
  `eval_Φ_two_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`) and
  `eval_Φ_three_ne_zero_of_root_ΨSq` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingSurjective`) now route
  through `eval_Φ_ne_zero_of_eval_ΨSq_ne_zero` and the `IsCoprime` instances of
  `EllipticCurves.DivisionPolynomial.Coprime`, which **do** rest on `Δ`-certificates — in exchange
  for dropping `[IsAlgClosed F]` and `(2 : F) ≠ 0` from both statements.  The two certificate-free
  proofs are retained verbatim as `example`s beside them, so neither route left the tree.
  **The economy of *this* file is unaffected**: its interface is still the pointwise statement, it
  still asks for no certificate, and `Coprime` is still not in its import closure.

## Main definitions

/-- **A value of `x` solves the multiplication-by-`n` equation as soon as `Φₙ − x₀·ΨSqₙ` splits.**
The polynomial has degree `n²` by `natDegree_Φ_sub_C_mul_ΨSq`, so it is not constant and a
splitting witness produces a root — Mathlib's `Polynomial.Splits.exists_eval_eq_zero`.

⚠️ This is the **only** thing `exists_eval_Φ_eq` below ever used its algebraic closure for, and the
hypothesis is a statement about one explicit polynomial at one explicit `x₀`, so a caller over a
field that is not algebraically closed can discharge it on a named curve.  Over a splitting field
of `Φₙ − x₀·ΨSqₙ` it holds by construction; transporting a *conclusion* back down to the base field
is a descent problem and is not this lemma's business.

⚠️ `Polynomial.Splits` takes **one** argument in this Mathlib — the `RingHom` form is gone.  A
`Splits` obligation appearing inside a proof as `(f.map φ).Splits` says something about the API that
consumes it, not about the arity of the predicate. -/

/-- The bridge from the Bézout form of coprimality to the pointwise no-common-root hypothesis used
below.  `IsCoprime (W.Φ n) (W.ΨSq n)` at general `n` is issue `#1184` and is available in this tree
only at `n = 2` (`isCoprime_Φ_two_Ψ₂Sq`) and `n = 3` (`isCoprime_Φ_three_ΨSq_three`); the
surjectivity engine below needs only the conclusion.

⚠️ This docstring used to end *"…which both available instances obtain without any Bézout
certificate"*.  That was true of the instances as they were merged and is no longer true of them:
both now route through `EllipticCurves.DivisionPolynomial.Coprime`, which is what let them drop
`[IsAlgClosed F]` and `(2 : F) ≠ 0`.  The certificate-free proofs survive as `example`s beside
them.  Nothing in this file changed with them, and `#1184` is still not in its import closure.

⚠️ **The proof used to unfold the Bézout witness by hand** — `obtain ⟨a, b, hab⟩ := h`, then
`congrArg (Polynomial.eval x)` and eight `eval_*` rewrites to reach `1 = 0`.  Not a step of that
used `Φ` or `ΨSq`: it was a reproof of Mathlib's `Polynomial.aeval_ne_zero_of_isCoprime`,
specialised in the statement only.  `#1255` replaced it by a derivation from that lemma, which
needs **no new import** — it is already in scope here.

⚠️ **The statement stays specialised to `(Φₙ, ΨSqₙ)`, and that was a decision** (`#1255`, item 2),
not an oversight.  An environment census — walking `env.constants` and testing `getUsedConstants`
over every value *and* type — reports **zero** consumers, so there is no call site pulling either
way and the tie is broken on reading.  Two reasons for the specialised form: it is named for what
it bridges, `#1184`'s `IsCoprime` into the `hroot` hypothesis below, and it reads that way at the
call site; and the general form is already a public lemma in this tree,
`Polynomial.eval_ne_zero_of_isCoprime` (`EllipticCurves.DivisionPolynomial.Coprime`), which this
file **cannot see** — restating it here would turn a specialisation into a literal duplicate, which
is the worse of the two shapes.  See *"The de-duplication question, decided"* in that file for the
priced alternatives. -/

section Formula

/-- **The multiplication-by-`n` coordinate formula**, as a predicate.  It says that at an affine
point `(x, y)` of `W` at which `ΨSqₙ` does not vanish, the multiple `n • (x, y)` is affine with
`x`-coordinate `Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)`.

This is the one index-dependent input of the surjectivity engine below.  Establishing it at general
`n` is issue `#251`; `hasXCoordFormula_two` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingSurjective`) and
`hasXCoordFormula_three` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingSurjective`) are the two cases available
in this tree. -/

/-- **A root of `Φₙ − x₀·ΨSqₙ` carrying a point of `W` above it makes `x₀` an `n`-fold
`x`-coordinate**, over an arbitrary field.

This is the engine's two closure uses promoted to arguments.  The merged
`exists_nsmul_some_of_hasXCoordFormula` below obtains `x` from `exists_eval_Φ_eq` and `y` from
`exists_equation`, and those are the only two
places `[IsAlgClosed F]` enters anywhere in this file; supplied by hand, the remaining seven lines
need no closure.

⚠️ The two uses are **dependent** — the point is sought above the *root* the first use produced — so
they cannot be bolted onto the merged statement as two independent hypotheses.  `x` and `y` are
arguments, and that is the whole design content of the finite-level form.

⚠️ **`h2` and `hn` are gone as well, and that is not an oversight.**  In the merged statement
`(2 : F) ≠ 0` is consumed only by `exists_equation` and `n ≠ 0` only by the degree count inside
`exists_eval_Φ_eq`.  Promote both uses and neither hypothesis has a consumer left: what is stated
here holds in every characteristic, at every `n`, over every field. -/

than for some point sharing its `x`-coordinate.
