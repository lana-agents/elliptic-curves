# Ward's theorem, the `r = 1` slice: infrastructure for the elliptic addition formula

The goal of Ward's theorem (`r = 1` slice) is, for the canonical normalised elliptic divisibility
sequence `W = normEDS b c d` over a `CommRing R`, the `r = 1` slice of the elliptic-net relation

```
IsEllipticNet.rel W p q 1 0 = 0    for all p q : ℤ,
```

which, using `W 1 = 1`, is exactly the **elliptic addition formula** of Ward (1948),

```
W (p + q) * W (p - q) = W (p + 1) * W (p - 1) * W q ^ 2 - W (q + 1) * W (q - 1) * W p ^ 2 .
```

This is a standing Mathlib `TODO` (`Mathlib/NumberTheory/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean`, "prove
that `normEDS` satisfies `IsEllipticDvdSequence`"). This file assembles the reusable, sorry-free
**infrastructure** for a proof:

* the **symmetry reductions** of the relator (even in `p`, even in `q`, antisymmetric under the swap
  `p ↔ q`), which reduce the statement to `p ≥ q ≥ 0`;
* the **collapse of the general `r`, `s = 0` relator onto the `r = 1` one**
  (`IsEllipticNet.one_sq_mul_rel_zero`), whence `IsEllipticSequence W ↔ ∀ p q, rel W p q 1 0 = 0`
  for odd normalised `W` — so the `r = 1` slice is not a *slice* of Mathlib's
  `IsEllipticSequence` at all, it is the whole of it, and the step between them is `ring`;
* the trivial `q ∈ {0, 1}` slices; the diagonal bands `p - q ∈ {1, 2}` are already the two-term
  recurrences `normEDS_rel_odd` / `normEDS_rel_even` of
  `EllipticCurves/Torsion/EllipticNetRel.lean`;
* the **universal-ring nonvanishing framework**: the identity sequence `n ↦ n` is `normEDS 2 3 2`
  (`normEDS_two_three_two`), whence `normEDS X₀ X₁ X₂ n ≠ 0` for `n ≠ 0` in the integral domain
  `ℤ[X₀, X₁, X₂]` (`normEDS_univ_ne_zero`). This lets the remaining Ward induction be carried out
  over a *domain* (where nonzero `W`-values may be cancelled) and then transferred to an arbitrary
  `CommRing` via `IsEllipticNet.map_rel` and the evaluation `Xᵢ ↦ b, c, d`.

The remaining `∀ p q` core is carried out in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.WardR1Core`, which imports
this file. ⚠️ **Ward's `r = 1` slice is still open**, but the remainder is narrower than *"the
induction over the domain"*: that file proves the diagonal `p = q` slice **unconditionally**
(`normEDS_rel_one_diag`, `Affine.ψ_rel_one_diag`) together with the full `UnivEDS → R` transfer,
and isolates everything left as the **single** hypothesis `WardGapCore` — for natural `b ≥ 2` and
`a ≥ b + 3`, `rel (normEDS X₀ X₁ X₂) a b 1 0 = 0` over `UnivEDS` — with `normEDS_rel_one_of_gapCore`
and `Affine.ψ_rel_one_of_gapCore` conditional on it. That hypothesis is all that is left of the
`r = 1` slice of the Mathlib `TODO`, and that file records why it admits no bounded-degree
certificate. ⚠️ This sentence used to read *"The remaining `∀ p q` core — the Ward
induction over the domain — is left to a follow-up"*: the follow-up was written, and what went
stale is the size it ascribes to the remainder. ⚠️ Every name this paragraph takes from
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.WardR1Core` — `WardGapCore`, `normEDS_rel_one_diag`,
`Affine.ψ_rel_one_diag`, `normEDS_rel_one_of_gapCore`, `Affine.ψ_rel_one_of_gapCore` — is a forward
reference: that module imports this file and is not in this file's import closure, so nothing below
uses any of them. Nothing else in the paragraph is: `UnivEDS` is defined below in this file, and
`rel` (Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet.rel`) and `normEDS` are Mathlib's — all three are what the
statements below are about.

## Main statements

* `IsEllipticNet.rel_one_neg_left`, `rel_one_neg_right`, `rel_one_swap` : symmetries of the relator.
* `IsEllipticNet.one_sq_mul_rel_zero` : `W 1 ^ 2 · rel W p q r 0` as a `W(·)²`-combination of three
  `r = 1` relators, for any odd `W`; `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticSequence_of_rel_one` and
  `isEllipticSequence_iff_rel_one` are its consequences.
* `IsEllipticNet.signMultiplesOfThree` : an odd sequence that satisfies the `r = 1` slice
  identically and is not an elliptic sequence — the witness that the normalisation `W 1 = 1`
  cannot be dropped from the two lemmas above.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_rel_one_zero`, `normEDS_rel_one_one` : the `q ∈ {0, 1}` slices.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_two_three_two` : `normEDS 2 3 2 n = n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_univ_ne_zero` : nonvanishing of `normEDS` in `ℤ[X₀, X₁, X₂]`.

+ W q ^ 2 · rel W r p 1 0`**, for every odd `W` over every `CommRing`.

⚠️ This is a **formal identity**, not a fact about elliptic divisibility sequences: no recurrence,
no `W 1 = 1`, no `normEDS` and no curve.  Writing `Aₓ = W (x + 1) · W (x - 1)` and `Bₓ = W x ^ 2`,
**six** of the nine terms of the right-hand side mention `W (x ± 1)`; those six appear in the cyclic
pattern `-Aₐ B_b B_c + A_b Bₐ B_c` and cancel; the three that survive are `W 1 ^ 2` times the
left-hand side.  Oddness is used in exactly one place, to rewrite `W (r - p)` as `-W (p - r)`.

Its content is that `Mathlib`'s `IsEllipticSequence W`, which is `∀ p q r, rel W p q r 0 = 0`,
carries **no information beyond its `r = 1` slice** — see `isEllipticSequence_iff_rel_one`. -/

/-- **The `r = 1` slice of the elliptic-net relation implies the whole `s = 0` layer**, for an odd
normalised `W`.  Immediate from `one_sq_mul_rel_zero`, since `W 1 = 1` makes the multiplier `1`. -/

/-- **`IsEllipticSequence W ↔ ∀ p q, rel W p q 1 0 = 0`**, for an odd normalised `W`.

The forward direction is `r := 1`; the reverse is `isEllipticSequence_of_rel_one`.  ⚠️ So Ward's
`r = 1` slice and the full `s = 0` elliptic-sequence property are **the same statement**, and the
step between them is a `ring` call rather than an induction.

⚠️ **`h1` cannot be dropped**: `signMultiplesOfThree` below is odd and satisfies the `r = 1` slice
`∀ p q, rel W p q 1 0 = 0` *identically*, yet is not an elliptic sequence
(`not_isEllipticSequence_signMultiplesOfThree`, witnessed at `rel W 3 6 9 0 = -1`).  It has
`W 1 = 0`, so it does not rule out weakening `h1` to *`W 1` is not a zero divisor* — over a domain,
to `W 1 ≠ 0`.  That weakening is available only because `one_sq_mul_rel_zero` is stated
unconditionally in `W 1`, with the factor `W 1 ^ 2` on the left rather than an `h1` hypothesis. -/
lemma isEllipticSequence_iff_rel_one (odd : W.Odd) (h1 : W 1 = 1) :
    IsEllipticSequence W ↔ ∀ p q : ℤ, rel W p q 1 0 = 0 :=
  ⟨fun h p q => h p q 1, isEllipticSequence_of_rel_one W odd h1⟩

/-! ### The normalisation `W 1 = 1` is necessary in `isEllipticSequence_of_rel_one`

Oddness alone does **not** let the `r = 1` slice be propagated to general `r`: the sequence below is
odd, satisfies `rel W p q 1 0 = 0` for *every* pair `p, q` — identically, not on a range — and is
not an elliptic sequence.  So the two lemmas above are stated at the right strength rather than
over-hypothesised.  ⚠️ Nothing here bears on `normEDS`, which is normalised
(`WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_one`), nor on Ward's theorem. -/
