# The `n`-torsion subgroup `E[n]` of a Weierstrass curve

For a Weierstrass curve `W` over a field `F`, the group of affine points `W.Point`
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point`) carries an `AddCommGroup` structure. Mathlib already provides the
`n`-torsion subgroup of an arbitrary additive commutative group `A` as `AddSubgroup.torsionBy`, with
the scoped notation `A[n]` for `n : ℤ` and the membership characterisation
`AddSubgroup.torsionBy.nsmul_iff`.

This file records the small pieces of general API that are still missing at the
`AddSubgroup.torsionBy` level (the values at `0` and `1`, and monotonicity in the divisibility
order), and specialises the construction to Weierstrass curves as
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsion W n`, the `n`-torsion subgroup `E[n]` — equivalently the kernel of
multiplication by `n` on `W.Point`.

The finiteness of `E[n]` and the structure theorem `E[n] ≃ (ℤ/nℤ)²` require relating torsion points
to the division polynomials, and are developed separately.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsion W n`: the `n`-torsion subgroup `E[n]` of `W.Point`.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mem_torsion_iff`: `P ∈ E[n] ↔ n • P = 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.add_self_eq_zero_of_mem_torsion_two`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.add_add_self_eq_zero_of_mem_torsion_three`: the same membership at
  `n = 2` and `n = 3` in the *additive* form `P ⊕ P = O`, `P ⊕ P ⊕ P = O`, which is the shape the
  translation and Weil-pairing files consume as a hypothesis binder.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsion_zero`, `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsion_one`:
  `E[0] = ⊤` and `E[1] = ⊥`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsion_mono`: `m ∣ n → E[m] ≤ E[n]`.

## ⚠️ One `@[simp]` attribute was removed here, and the lemma kept (`#1278`)

`nsmul_mem_torsion` carried `@[simp]`, and it is a **straight duplicate of Mathlib's
`AddSubgroup.torsionBy.nsmul`**, which is already `@[simp]` — so the default simp set proves it and
the attribute only added a second entry for the same rewrite. Measured with Mathlib's `simpNF`
environment linter, which had never been run on this tree. ⚠️ The lemma is kept and unchanged: it
has eleven named consumers across five files, and the point of the name is to state the fact in
`W.torsion` vocabulary rather than `AddSubgroup.torsionBy`.

/-- `E[2]` membership as the two-term group relation `P ⊕ P = O`.

`mem_torsion_iff` states it as `2 • P = 0`, but the consumers in `FunctionField/` — the translation
and Weil-pairing files — take the additive form as a hypothesis binder, e.g.
`weilPairingElt_pow_eq_one_of_gS_two_torsion` asks for
`torsionPoint hT + torsionPoint hT = 0`.  ⚠️ This is deliberately *not* routed through
`mem_torsion_two_some_iff` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsion`), which gives the different normal
form `P = -P`: reaching `P ⊕ P = O` from there costs an extra `add_eq_zero_iff_eq_neg` at every
site, which is why no consumer used it. -/

/-- `E[3]` membership as the three-term group relation `P ⊕ P ⊕ P = O`.

The `n = 3` twin of `add_self_eq_zero_of_mem_torsion_two`, wanted for the same reason: it is the
hypothesis binder of `weilPairingElt_pow_eq_one_of_gS_three_baseField` and of the `3`-torsion
translation lemmas.  ⚠️ As at `n = 2`, this is not the same normal form as
`mem_torsion_three_iff_add_self_eq_neg` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeTorsion`), which says
`P ⊕ P = ⊖P`. -/
