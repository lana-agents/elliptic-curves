# The `y`-coordinate division-polynomial numerators `Ωₙ` and their factorisation

Mathlib's `Mathlib/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/DivisionPolynomial/Basic.lean` develops the
`x`-coordinate division polynomials (`ψ₂, Ψ₂Sq, Ψ₃, preΨ₄, ΨSq, Ψ, Φ, ψ, φ`) but explicitly leaves
the *`y`-coordinate* division polynomials `ωₙ` as a `TODO`. The downstream files
`EllipticCurves/Torsion/OmegaTwo.lean` and `EllipticCurves/Torsion/OmegaThree.lean` supply the
*point-evaluated* on-curve identity for the duplication (`n = 2`) and tripling (`n = 3`) maps.

This file builds the **general-`n` substrate** those low-index files use implicitly, in a form
reusable by the multiplication-by-`n` function-field pullback `[n]∗ : F(W) → F(W)`.

The `y`-coordinate of `[n]P` is governed by the bracket appearing in the index-doubling formula
`ψ₂ₙ = ψₙ · (ψₙ₊₂ψₙ₋₁² − ψₙ₋₂ψₙ₊₁²) / ψ₂` (Silverman AEC, Exercise 3.7). We name

* `WeierstrassCurve.preΩ n`, the **univariate** numerator
  `preΩₙ = preΨₙ₊₂·preΨₙ₋₁² − preΨₙ₋₂·preΨₙ₊₁² ∈ R[X]`, and
* `WeierstrassCurve.Ω n`, the **bivariate** numerator
  `Ωₙ = ψₙ₊₂·ψₙ₋₁² − ψₙ₋₂·ψₙ₊₁² ∈ R[X][Y]`,

and establish:

* `preΨ_five` : the closed form `preΨ₅ = preΨ₄·Ψ₂Sq² − Ψ₃³`, from the odd `preΨ'` recurrence.
* `preΨ₄_sq` : the univariate identity `preΨ₄² = 4Φ₂³ + b₂Φ₂²Ψ₂Sq + 2b₄Φ₂Ψ₂Sq² + b₆Ψ₂Sq³` relating
  `preΨ₄`, `Φ₂` and `Ψ₂Sq`.
* `preΩ_two`/`preΩ_three` : `preΩ₂ = preΨ₄` and `preΩ₃ = preΨ₅ − preΨ₄²`, reconciling with the exact
  univariate factors `Kᵥ` used in `OmegaTwo`/`OmegaThree` (validating the general definition against
  the two independently-proved low-index cases).
* `preΩ_neg` : `preΩ` is an even function of the index.
* `map_preΩ` : `preΩ` commutes with base change, the `preΩ` member of Mathlib's
  `map_preΨ` / `map_ΨSq` / `map_Φ` family.
* `ψ_mul_Ω` : the index-doubling bridge `ψ₂ₙ · ψ₂ = ψₙ · Ωₙ`, a repackaging of Mathlib's `ψ_even`.
* `Ω_factor` : the parity factorisation, at the level of the honest bivariate polynomials `Ψ`,
  `Ψₙ₊₂·Ψₙ₋₁² − Ψₙ₋₂·Ψₙ₊₁² = (if Even n then ψ₂ else ψ₂²)·C(preΩₙ)`, exhibiting the bivariate
  numerator as a power of `ψ₂` times the univariate `preΩₙ` — the parity split that makes the
  `y`-coordinate of `[n]P` computable from univariate data.
* `preΨ_two_mul` : the same index doubling **univariately and with no hypotheses**,
  `preΨ₂ₙ = preΨₙ·preΩₙ`, which is Mathlib's `preΨ_even` with the common `preΨₙ` pulled out.
* `ΨSq_two_mul` : its squared form `ΨSq₂ₙ = ΨSqₙ·(preΩₙ²·(if Even n then 1 else Ψ₂Sq))`, whose
  parity factor is the one in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaOnCurve`'s `HasPreΩSq` — this is the
  lemma that removes `preΩ` from that predicate.
* `Affine.ψ_two_mul_evalEval` : the two preceding lemmas combined and the common factor of `ψ₂`
  cancelled, at a point `(x, y)` of `W` where `ψ₂` does not vanish:
  `ψ₂ₙ(x, y) = ψₙ(x, y)·(if Even n then 1 else ψ₂(x, y))·preΩₙ(x)`.  Equivalently
  `(if Even n then 1 else ψ₂)·preΩₙ = ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ`, which is the quantity Silverman's `ωₙ` is built
  from, and it is what identifies the parity factor of
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaOnCurve`'s `HasPreΩSq` as this factorisation rather than a bare
  degree count.  ⚠️ Pointwise only, and the restriction is a property of the **bivariate** pair:
  `Ω_factor` is about `Ψ` and `Ω` is defined from `ψ`, and the two agree only after evaluation at a
  point of `W`.  Univariately there is no such restriction — that is `preΨ_two_mul` above.
* `Affine.ψ_four_evalEval` : the `n = 2` specialisation, landing on Mathlib's `ψ_four`; a
  non-vacuity check on the general statement rather than new content.

`preΨ_five` and `preΨ₄_sq` are pure `CommRing` statements about `preΨ` — no point, no field, no
characteristic hypothesis — and they feed the `n = 2` and `n = 3` instances of the general-`n`
on-curve engine in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaOnCurve`, which is why they live here rather than
in the point-level files that used to hold them.

The remaining crux for the full general-`n` on-curve identity `W.Equation (Φₙ/ΨSqₙ) (ωₙ/ψₙ³)` is the
**univariate** identity `WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq` of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaOnCurve` — the
`ΨSqₙ`-weighted, parity-corrected analogue of `preΨ₄_sq` at general `n`, established there for
`n ∈ {0, ±1, ±2}`, and at `n = 3` in the evaluated form `HasPreΩSqAt` there and in the polynomial
form in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaCharZero`. It is the *only*
index-dependent input: the uniform half `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.equation_of_hasPreΩSqAt` derives
the Weierstrass equation at the division-polynomial coordinates from it alone, over any field of
characteristic `≠ 2` at a point with `ψₙ(x, y) ≠ 0`. This file supplies the numerator infrastructure
both consume.

⚠️ `ΨSq_two_mul` above is what lets that crux be restated **without `preΩ`**, as
`WeierstrassCurve.HasΨSqDoubling` in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaOnCurve`; the two are equivalent
and neither is easier. So `preΩ` is the vocabulary the crux was *first written in*, not a
constituent of it — which is worth knowing before extending this file with further `preΩ` lemmas
aimed at the crux.

⚠️ Identifying `(Φₙ/ΨSqₙ, ωₙ/ψₙ³)` with the group-law multiple `n • P` is a **separate** statement
(`#251`), not an equivalent of the above and not a gate on it — `equation_of_hasPreΩSqAt` takes no
group-law input. `EllipticCurves.Torsion.DoublingCoords` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TriplingCoords`
supply it at `n = 2` and `n = 3`. The `OmegaTwo`/`OmegaThree` docstrings make the same disclaimer,
`OmegaTwo` calling the `2 • P` identification "a separate, harder statement not proved here" and
`OmegaThree` calling the `3 • P` one "a separate statement" that `TriplingCoords` does prove.

/-- **The index-doubling bridge, at the univariate level and with no hypotheses at all**:
`preΨ₂ₙ = preΨₙ · preΩₙ`.

This is Mathlib's `preΨ_even` with the common factor of `preΨₙ` pulled out, and the bracket that
remains is `preΩₙ` on the nose.  ⚠️ It is the univariate counterpart of `ψ_mul_Ω`, but it is
**strictly stronger in shape than that lemma is**: `ψ_mul_Ω` carries a spurious factor of `ψ₂` on
each side, which `Affine.ψ_two_mul_evalEval` below can only cancel at a point where `ψ₂` does not
vanish, and only after `ψ_evalEval` has reconciled `ψ` with `Ψ`.  Here there is nothing to cancel
and nothing to reconcile: `preΨ` and `preΩ` are both univariate, the identity is an equation in
`R[X]` over an arbitrary `CommRing`, and it holds at the `2`-torsion points too.

⚠️ `Affine.ψ_two_mul_evalEval`'s docstring says that it is *"a pointwise statement and there is no
polynomial-level version"*.  That remark is about the **bivariate** pair `Ψ`/`Ω` — `Ω_factor` is
stated for `Ψ` while `Ω` is defined from `ψ`, and those agree only on the curve.  It is not a claim
that index doubling has no polynomial-level form, and this lemma is that form. -/

/-- **Index doubling for the squared division polynomial**:
`ΨSq₂ₙ = ΨSqₙ · (preΩₙ² · (if Even n then 1 else Ψ₂Sq))`.

The parity factor on the right is exactly the one in `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaOnCurve`'s
`WeierstrassCurve.HasPreΩSq`, and that is not a coincidence: this lemma is what turns that
predicate into a statement with no `preΩ` in it — see
`WeierstrassCurve.hasPreΩSq_iff_hasΨSqDoubling` there.

⚠️ The two branches meet: `ΨSqₙ` carries `Ψ₂Sq` exactly when `n` is even and the parity factor
carries it exactly when `n` is odd, so the product carries it in both cases, which is what makes
the left-hand side — with `2n` always even — come out uniformly. -/

/-- **The index-doubling formula at a point, with the parity factor made explicit.**  For a point
`(x, y)` of `W` at which `ψ₂` does not vanish,

```
ψ₂ₙ(x, y) = ψₙ(x, y) · (if Even n then 1 else ψ₂(x, y)) · preΩₙ(x).
```

This is `ψ_mul_Ω` (`ψ₂ₙ·ψ₂ = ψₙ·Ωₙ`) combined with `Ω_factor` (`Ωₙ = ψ₂^(1 or 2)·preΩₙ` after
`ψ_evalEval`), with the one common factor of `ψ₂` cancelled.  Equivalently
`(if Even n then 1 else ψ₂)·preΩₙ = ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ`, which is the quantity Silverman's `ωₙ` is built from:
`2ωₙ = ψ₂ₙ/ψₙ − ψₙ·(a₁Φₙ + a₃ΨSqₙ)` (AEC, Exercise 3.7).

⚠️ **`hψ₂` is not decoration.**  The proof cancels a common factor of `ψ₂` at the point, and
`ψ₂(x, y) = 2y + a₁x + a₃` vanishes exactly at the `2`-torsion points of `W`; there the identity
carries no information, since `ψ_mul_Ω` reads `0 = ψₙ·Ωₙ` after evaluation.

⚠️ This is a **pointwise** statement and there is no polynomial-level version *of it*: `Ω_factor`
is stated for the honest bivariate `Ψ`, while `Ω` is defined from `ψ`, and `ψₙ` is only *congruent*
to `Ψₙ` modulo `W.polynomial`.  They agree only after evaluation at a point of `W`, via
`ψ_evalEval`, which is what `h` supplies.

⚠️ **That restriction is a fact about the bivariate polynomials, not about index doubling.**  The
univariate identity `preΨ_two_mul`, `preΨ₂ₙ = preΨₙ·preΩₙ`, holds in `R[X]` over an arbitrary
`CommRing` with no point, no `Equation` and no `ψ₂ ≠ 0` — including at the `2`-torsion points where
this lemma carries no information.  Read the sentence above as *"`ψ` and `Ψ` do not agree off the
curve"*, not as *"index doubling is available only pointwise"*. -/

/-- **Non-vacuity at `n = 2`: the general index-doubling formula lands on Mathlib's `ψ_four`.**
Specialising `ψ_two_mul_evalEval` at `n = 2` uses `preΩ₂ = preΨ₄` and the even branch of the parity
factor, and produces `ψ₄(x, y) = ψ₂(x, y)·preΨ₄(x)` — which is exactly Mathlib's

⚠️ This is a **check on the general statement, not new content**: the same identity holds at every
`(x, y)` with no hypotheses at all, straight from `ψ_four`.  It is proved here through the engine
precisely so that a general statement which failed to specialise to the known `n = 2` factorisation
