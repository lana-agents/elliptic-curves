# `#E[n] = n²` and `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²` at every `n` prime to the characteristic

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaChordSum` proves `#E[n] = n²` at **odd** `n`
(`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_eq_sq_of_odd`), because its route runs through
`Separable (preΨₙ)` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OddTorsionCount`'s `2`-to-`1` count of the nonzero
`n`-torsion over the roots of `preΨₙ`, which is odd-`n` by construction.

**This file removes the parity restriction, and the argument is arithmetic, not geometric.**  Write
`n = 2^a · m` with `m` odd.  The two factors are coprime, `#E[2^a] = 4^a` has been on `main` since
the `2`-primary tower and was never gated on the Wronskian identity, and `#E[m] = m²` is the odd
theorem.  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.Coprime`'s `card_torsion_mul` multiplies them.  ⚠️ **Every** `n`
is `2^a · (odd)`, so this covers every index, not a wider slice of them:

```
#E[n] = n²                       for every n with (2 : F) ≠ 0 and (n : F) ≠ 0.
```

The structure theorem follows by the same shape one level up.  `#E[p] = p²` is now available at
**every** prime `p` with `(p : F) ≠ 0`, and `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionOrder`) has supplied surjectivity of `[p]` at every nonzero index
since PR #569 — so `EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTower`'s `nonempty_torsionPow_addEquiv` applies at
every prime power, and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.CoprimeStructure`'s
`nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_zmod_sq_of_coprime` glues the prime powers along
`Nat.recOnPosPrimePosCoprime`:

```
E[n] ≃+ ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ              for every n with (2 : F) ≠ 0 and (n : F) ≠ 0.
```

That is `#242`, the structure theorem for the `n`-torsion, and `#293`'s conclusion.

## ⚠️ There are **two** hypotheses, and only one of them is in the names

Every one of the seven public statements below takes `(2 : F) ≠ 0` **as well as** its index
hypothesis, and until `#1137` swept this front the module prose, the index and thirty-three
citations in twenty-four other files all named only the index one. ⚠️ The omission is not cosmetic:
the assembly writes `n = 2^a · m` and spends `card_torsion_two_pow` on the first factor, and the odd
factor is reached through the `x`-support, so **no statement in this file reaches characteristic `2`
at any index** — not even at odd `n`, where the conclusion is stated for `n` and not for `m`.

⚠️ **`(2 : F) ≠ 0` is a hypothesis, not a known obstruction, and the two must not be conflated.**
What is recorded here is that *this route* does not reach characteristic `2`; nothing here claims
`#E[n] = n²` fails there, and at odd `n` in characteristic `2` the index is still prime to the
characteristic, so the classical statement (Silverman AEC III.6.4) is untouched by the restriction
— it is simply not proved in this tree.  Contrast the index hypothesis, where `p = char F` really
does make the conclusion false: that is the next section, and the difference is the whole reason
both hypotheses have to be written down.

## Why the hypothesis is `(n : F) ≠ 0` and not `Odd n`

⚠️ `(n : F) ≠ 0` is not a convenience; it is the sharp condition, and at `p = char F` the
conclusion is **false** rather than unproved — `E[p]` is `0` or `ℤ/pℤ` there, never `(ℤ/pℤ)²`.  So a
docstring recording "the even case" as open is describing a gap that does not exist, while one
recording the characteristic case as open is correct.

## ⚠️ The second, independent route at odd `n`

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTowerOdd` landed in the same window as this file and reaches the
same conclusion at every **odd** `n` with `(n : F) ≠ 0`.  Comparing the two routes to
`E[n] ≃+ (ℤ/nℤ)²` at a general index:

* **`nonempty_torsion_addEquiv` (here)** runs `PrimaryTower` at each prime power of `n` and glues
  along `Nat.recOnPosPrimePosCoprime`.  The rank bound `#E[n][q] ≤ q²` is spent only *inside*
  `PrimaryTower`, at a prime power; this file never states one.  Range: every `n` with
  `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `(n : F) ≠ 0`.
* **`nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_of_odd` (`PrimaryTowerOdd`)** proves the rank bound at `n` itself
  (`card_nsmul_eq_zero_torsion_le_of_odd`) and hands it with the count straight to
  `AddCommGroup.equiv_zmod_sq_of_card_sq` — no prime-power ascent and no gluing.  Range: odd `n`
  with `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `(n : F) ≠ 0`.

Neither file imports the other's headline, so at odd `n` the two are a genuine cross-check on the
**assembly**.  ⚠️ They are not independent about the *input*: both ultimately spend
`card_torsion_eq_sq_of_odd`, and a defect there would be invisible to the comparison.

⚠️ `nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_of_odd` and `card_nsmul_eq_zero_torsion_le_of_odd` are **not**
subsumed by anything here and must not be deleted, nor are the `_of_odd` tower statements
(`card_torsion_pow_of_odd`, `finite_torsion_pow_of_odd`, `card_torsion_pow_mul_self_of_odd`,
`nonempty_torsionPow_addEquiv_of_odd`): they are what `PrimaryTower`'s gate list is *about*, and
`card_torsion_pow_mul_self_of_odd` is stated in the `Nat.card (W.torsion n) = n * n` shape that
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryBasis`'s `torsionPairHom_bijective_of_card` and
`EllipticCurves.TateModule.PrimaryFree`'s `padicPairHom_injective` take their `hcard` in — 18
`TateModule/` module docstrings name it as their discharger.  ⚠️ None of them *calls* it yet; the
citations are prose, and feeding the count in is separate work.

## What each input contributes, so that nothing here is mistaken for new mathematics

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_eq_sq_of_odd` (`Torsion.OmegaChordSum`) — the odd count.
  This is the only deep input, and it is the whole of `#1506` item 1's payoff.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_two_pow` (`Torsion.TwoPrimary`) — `#E[2^k] = 4^k`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_mul` (`Torsion.Coprime`) — `#E[mn] = #E[m]·#E[n]` at coprime
  `m`, `n`, ⚠️ **with no finiteness hypothesis**, which is what lets the count be assembled before
  finiteness is known at `n`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionPow_addEquiv` (`Torsion.PrimaryTower`) — the prime-power
  structure theorem from surjectivity and `#E[p] = p²`.  ⚠️ It is the *only* statement in that file
  that needs `p.Prime`, and this file supplies exactly the two hypotheses it was written to take.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_zmod_sq_of_coprime`
  (`Torsion.CoprimeStructure`) — the Chinese-remainder glue.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero` (`Torsion.TwoTorsionOrder`) —
  surjectivity of `[n]` at every `n ≠ 0`.  ⚠️ It does **not** need `(n : F) ≠ 0`, and it has been a
  theorem since long before the count was; nothing about the `≥ n²` half follows from it.

**No new geometry, no new polynomial identity and no new curve is used below.**

## Main statements

⚠️ Every public declaration of this file is listed: **7 public, 0 private.**

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_eq_sq` : **`#E[n] = n²` at every `n` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`
  and `(n : F) ≠ 0`.**
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionPrimePow_addEquiv` : `E[p^k] ≃+ (ℤ/p^kℤ)²` at every
  prime `p` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `(p : F) ≠ 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsion_addEquiv` : **`E[n] ≃+ ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ` at every `n` with
  `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `(n : F) ≠ 0`** — `#242`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_five`, `…nonempty_torsionFive_addEquiv` : the first index
  outside `{2, 3}`-smooth, which is where every previous statement of both results stopped.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_ten`, `…nonempty_torsionTen_addEquiv` : the first **even**
  index reachable by neither the `3`-smooth statements nor the odd ones.

## ⚠️ What this does NOT do

* **Nothing at `n = 0` in `F`.**  `(n : F) ≠ 0` is a hypothesis of every statement, and in
  characteristic `p` the conclusion is false at `p ∣ n`, not merely unavailable.  ⚠️ `(2 : F) ≠ 0`
  is a hypothesis of every statement too — see the two-hypotheses section above — but there the
  conclusion is unavailable rather than false.
* It proves **no** new identity about division polynomials and touches no file that does.
* It does not touch `EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTower`'s gate list, which is `#1522`.  ⚠️ That
  gate is `#E[p] = p²` and `card_torsion_eq_sq` discharges it at every `p` with `(p : F) ≠ 0`, but
  `PrimaryTower` is *upstream* of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaChordSum` and so cannot import this
  file; the discharge has to happen in a leaf.  It happens in
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTowerOdd`, a sibling leaf landed in the same window as this one —
  see the section above.  ⚠️ That file is **not** superseded by this one and must not be deleted:
  its `_of_odd` statements are the shape `PrimaryTower`'s gate list is written in and the shape the
  `PrimaryBasis` and `TateModule` consumers take.
* `#268` (`T_ℓ E ≅ ℤ_ℓ²`) is not assembled here, though `nonempty_torsion_addEquiv` is the input it
  was waiting for at `ℓ ≥ 5`.

/-! ### The count -/

/-- **`#E[n] = n²` at every `n` with `(n : F) ≠ 0`**, with no parity hypothesis.

Split `n = 2^a · m` at the `2`-adic valuation: `Nat.ordProj_mul_ordCompl_eq_self` gives the
factorisation and `Nat.not_dvd_ordCompl` gives that `m` is odd, hence coprime to `2^a`.  Then
`card_torsion_mul` reduces the count to `#E[2^a] = 4^a` (`card_torsion_two_pow`, which never
depended on the Wronskian identity) and `#E[m] = m²` (`card_torsion_eq_sq_of_odd`).

⚠️ `(m : F) ≠ 0` is inherited from `(n : F) ≠ 0` rather than assumed: `m` divides `n`, so a
vanishing `m` would force a vanishing `n`.  That is the only place the hypothesis is used at the
odd factor, and it is why the statement needs `(n : F) ≠ 0` and not the stronger `n` prime to
`char F` spelled out prime by prime. -/

`nonempty_torsionPow_addEquiv` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTower`) takes exactly two inputs
beyond primality: surjectivity of `[p]`, which `nsmul_surjective_of_two_ne_zero` supplies at every
nonzero index, and `#E[p] = p²`, which `card_torsion_eq_sq` now supplies at every `p` with
`(p : F) ≠ 0`.  ⚠️ The general-`p` form of `nonempty_torsionTwoPow_addEquiv` and of
`nonempty_torsionThreePow_addEquiv`, and it subsumes both. -/

/-- **`E[n] ≃+ ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/nℤ` at every `n` with `(n : F) ≠ 0`** — the structure theorem for the
`n`-torsion of an elliptic curve over an algebraically closed field, `#242`.

`Nat.recOnPosPrimePosCoprime` reduces to prime powers and coprime products.  The prime-power case is
`nonempty_torsionPrimePow_addEquiv`; the coprime case is
`nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_zmod_sq_of_coprime`; `n = 0` is excluded by the hypothesis, and `n = 1`
is `nonempty_torsionTwoPow_addEquiv` at `k = 0`, which is the same trick Mathlib's own
`Nat.recOnPrimeCoprime` uses to reach `1`.

⚠️ The hypothesis `(n : F) ≠ 0` propagates in both directions of the recursion without extra work: a
divisor of `n` cannot vanish in `F` if `n` does not, and that is all either branch needs.

⚠️ This **subsumes** `nonempty_torsion_addEquiv_zmod_sq_of_smooth`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreePrimary`), whose `3`-smooth `n ≠ 0` with `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, `(3 : F) ≠ 0`
forces `(n : F) ≠ 0`; the `example` below is the machine-checked form of that claim.  It does not
subsume anything at `p = char F`, where the conclusion is false. -/

preferring it.  `n = 2^a·3^b ≠ 0` with `2 ≠ 0` and `3 ≠ 0` in `F` forces `(n : F) ≠ 0`; this is that
implication, machine-checked, and it is the reason the docstring above may claim subsumption. -/
