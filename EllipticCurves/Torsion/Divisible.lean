# Sharp multiplicativity of torsion counts for divisible groups

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.Multiplicative` builds the homomorphism

```
AddSubgroup.torsionSmulHom A m n : A[m * n] →+ A[m],      P ↦ n • P
```

and derives the *inequality* `#A[m * n] ≤ #A[m] · #A[n]` from the first isomorphism theorem: its
kernel injects into `A[n]` and its range into `A[m]`. This file shows that **both injections are
equalities under a divisibility hypothesis**, so the inequality becomes an equality:

* the kernel is *exactly* `A[n]`, with no hypothesis at all — an element killed by `n` is
  automatically killed by `m * n`, so it already lies in `A[m * n]`;
* the range is *all* of `A[m]` as soon as `[n] : A → A` is surjective — lift `Q ∈ A[m]` to `a` with
  `n • a = Q`, and then `(m * n) • a = m • Q = 0`.

Hence

```
Nat.card A[m * n] = Nat.card A[m] * Nat.card A[n]        whenever `[n]` is surjective on `A`,
```

with **no finiteness hypothesis**: `AddSubgroup.card_mul_index` is unconditional, and the
`Nat.card = 0` convention makes both sides vanish together in the infinite case (`A[n]` embeds in
`A[m * n]`, and `A[m]` is a quotient of it, so either one being infinite forces `A[m * n]` to be
infinite).

## The three siblings

There are now three multiplicativity statements for torsion counts, and **none subsumes another**:

| file | hypothesis | conclusion |
|---|---|---|
| `Torsion.Multiplicative` | none (but `Finite`) | `#A[mn] ≤ #A[m]·#A[n]` |
| `Torsion.Coprime` | `IsCoprime m n` | `#A[mn] = #A[m]·#A[n]` |
| this file | `[n]` surjective on `A` | `#A[mn] = #A[m]·#A[n]` |

(the lemmas are `card_torsionBy_mul_le`, `card_torsionBy_mul_of_isCoprime` and
`card_torsionBy_mul_of_surjective` respectively).

The coprime statement says nothing at `m = n`, which is exactly the case the divisibility statement
is designed for: it is what turns `#E[2] = 4` into the whole `2`-primary tower `#E[2^k] = 4^k`.

## Main statements

* `AddSubgroup.kerTorsionSmulHom_bijective`: the kernel of `torsionSmulHom A m n` is exactly `A[n]`.
* `AddSubgroup.card_ker_torsionSmulHom`: the resulting cardinality identity.
* `AddSubgroup.torsionSmulHom_surjective`: surjectivity of `[n]` on `A` makes the homomorphism
  `torsionSmulHom A m n` surjective.
* `AddSubgroup.card_torsionBy_mul_of_surjective`: the sharp count.

/-- **Every element of `A[n]` already lies in the kernel of `torsionSmulHom A m n`.** If `n • a = 0`
then `(m * n) • a = m • (n • a) = 0`, so `a` lies in `A[m * n]`, and by construction it is killed by
multiplication by `n`. Together with `kerTorsionSmulHom_injective` this identifies the kernel with
`A[n]` on the nose; no hypothesis on `m` or `n` is needed. -/

/-- **The torsion count is sharply multiplicative for a divisible group.** If multiplication by `n`
is surjective on `A`, then

```
Nat.card A[m * n] = Nat.card A[m] * Nat.card A[n].
```

There is deliberately **no `Finite` hypothesis**: `AddSubgroup.card_mul_index` is unconditional, and
under the `Nat.card = 0` convention both sides vanish together in the infinite case, since `A[n]`
embeds into `A[m * n]` and `A[m]` is a quotient of it.

Compare `card_torsionBy_mul_le` (the inequality, always) and `card_torsionBy_mul_of_isCoprime` (the
equality for coprime `m`, `n`); this is the third, independent, sharpening. -/
