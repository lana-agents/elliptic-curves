# `#E[n] = n²` at odd `n`, reduced to one Wronskian identity and one coprimality

Issue `#1506`.  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OddTorsionCount` proves that over an algebraically closed
field of characteristic `≠ 2`, at an odd `n` with `char F ∤ n`,

```
#E[n] = n²   ↔   Separable (preΨₙ),
```

so the last gate on the `p`-primary tower (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTower`, `#1490` item 3)
is the separability of one univariate polynomial.  **This file discharges that gate from two
inputs, neither of which mentions torsion, points, or the group law.**  ⚠️ Both inputs are proved
downstream (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaPairCoprime` and `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaChordSum`),
so at odd `n` the chain that starts here is unconditional; see
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTowerOdd`.

## The two inputs

* the **Wronskian identity** — this is `[n]∗ω = nω` on the invariant differential, written in
  `F[X]` with no differentials:

  ```
  Φₙ′ · ΨSqₙ  −  Φₙ · ΨSqₙ′  =  n · preΨₙ · preΩₙ ;
  ```

* `IsCoprime (preΨₙ) (preΩₙ)`.

⚠️ **Neither is proved here, and this file is not a proof of `#E[n] = n²`.**  It is the assembly,
in the idiom of `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionPow_addEquiv_of_card`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTowerAlgClosed`): one signature from which a reader can see the
whole of what is owed.  `#1506` records the route to each input, and the evidence for both.

## Why those two inputs suffice, in three lines

`Separable p` **is** `IsCoprime p p′`.  At odd `n` the parity branch of `ΨSqₙ` is trivial, so
`ΨSqₙ = preΨₙ²` and the identity divides by `preΨₙ` — which is nonzero because `char F ∤ n` — to

```
Φₙ′ · preΨₙ  −  2 · Φₙ · preΨₙ′  =  n · preΩₙ .
```

A Bézout certificate for `(preΨₙ, preΩₙ)` therefore becomes one for `(preΨₙ, preΨₙ′)` after
substituting `preΩₙ = n⁻¹·(Φₙ′·preΨₙ − 2Φₙ·preΨₙ′)`, and `n⁻¹` exists exactly because
`(n : F) ≠ 0`.

⚠️ **`(n : F) ≠ 0` is spent in exactly one place and that is the point.**  It is the only step that
can fail, and it must be able to fail: in characteristic `p` the conclusion `#E[p] = p²` is false.
A route that did not consume the hypothesis there would be proving something untrue.

## Main statements

⚠️ Every public declaration of this file is listed.

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.separable_preΨ_of_wronskian` : `Separable (preΨₙ)` from the two inputs,
  at **odd** `n` over any field with `char F ∤ n`; **no** algebraic closure, **no**
  `[W.IsElliptic]`, and **nothing about `(2 : F)`**.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_eq_sq_of_wronskian` : `#E[n] = n²` from the same two inputs
  at the same odd `n` with `char F ∤ n`, plus what `card_torsion_eq_sq_iff_separable_preΨ` itself
  asks — `[IsAlgClosed F]`, `[W.IsElliptic]` and `(2 : F) ≠ 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub_eq_neg_Φ_mul_ΨSq` : `ψ_{n+q}·ψ_{n−q} = −Φₙ(x)·ΨSq_q(x)`
  at a point `(x, y)` **on the curve** where `ψₙ` vanishes, at every `q`.  ⚠️ Merged content,
  repackaged: it is `ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub_evalEval` with one term killed.  ⚠️ **Named for its
  conclusion, not for its hypothesis**: `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub_of_ψ_eq_zero`
  (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.NsmulYPeriodic`) is a *different* statement — Ward at `(d, n, 1, 0)`,
  `ψ_{d+n}·ψ_{d−n} = ψ_{d+1}·ψ_{d−1}·ψₙ²` — and renaming this one back would break the root import.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.eval_preΩ_ne_zero_of_eval_preΨ_eq_zero` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isCoprime_preΨ_preΩ` : the **second** input reduced to a single pointwise
  identity `hpair`, spending three merged facts on the way.  Over `F̄` with `[W.IsElliptic]` and
  `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, at an odd `n ≠ 0`; the first is the pointwise form and adds a root `x` of `preΨₙ`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_eq_sq_of_wronskian_of_pair` : both reductions composed.
  Over `F̄` with `[W.IsElliptic]` and `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, at an odd `n ≠ 0` with `char F ∤ n`,
  `#E[n] = n²` with the two equations `hid` and `hpair` **the only gates left**.

⚠️ **Every bullet above names the whole explicit hypothesis list of the declaration it is about**,
and this list carries **no register** at its head on purpose.  It used to mix registers — bullet 1
naming its own hypotheses and its own negatives, bullet 2 a different set, bullet 4 naming only the
gate its two declarations reduce, and `…_of_wronskian_of_pair` asserting there were none — which is
what `README.md` `### Scope of the rules above` forbids.

⚠️ **And that includes `h : W.Equation x y`, which is why bullet 3 says *"on the curve"*.**  The
conclusion of `ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub_eq_neg_Φ_mul_ΨSq` typechecks without `h`, so `h` is a hypothesis
and **not** a data argument of the object the bullet is about — being an explicit argument of that
object is the **necessary** half of the data-argument clearance (`README.md` `### Reach clauses`,
`#1631`), and this conclusion takes no such argument.  ⚠️ This used to cite the clearance
`### Module-block bullets` gave `residueDegreeN n hn p`; that reading is withdrawn, the verdict on
this row is not, and it never rested on it.  Nor is it left to
`### Gate-discharge claims`' *"the setting"*: bullet 3 makes no gate-discharge claim at all, and
that register carries claims about **gates**, saying in terms that it *"is not a licence to say
the signature is short"*.  The same reading repaired
`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.WeilPairingAlternatingBaseChangeN`'s two rows (`#1619`, PR #643).

⚠️ **A register at the head would have to say *"except"* twice**, which is why there is none.
`ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub_eq_neg_Φ_mul_ΨSq` is at every `n : ℤ` and takes neither `Odd n` nor an index
condition; and the index condition of the other five is not one clause but two —
`separable_preΨ_of_wronskian`, `card_torsion_eq_sq_of_wronskian` and `…_of_wronskian_of_pair` bind
`(n : F) ≠ 0`, which is where the proof divides by `preΨₙ`, while
`eval_preΩ_ne_zero_of_eval_preΨ_eq_zero` and `isCoprime_preΨ_preΩ` bind only `n ≠ 0`.
⚠️ `…_of_wronskian_of_pair` binds **both**, which is why its bullet names both — and `n ≠ 0` is
named beside `Odd n` in bullets 4 and 5, the rows whose signatures carry it separately, even though
`¬ Odd 0` derives it; bullets 1 and 2 do not name it because those two signatures do not bind it.
Instance arguments need **not** be listed (`README.md` `### Reach clauses`), and `[DecidableEq F]`
is named nowhere above; the mentions that do appear (*"over `F̄`"*, *"`[W.IsElliptic]`"*, and
bullet 1's three absences) were each checked against the declaration's own instance list.

⚠️ So the gate is **two identities**, not a research programme: the Wronskian one, and `hpair`.

⚠️ **`hpair` is now proved** — `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaPairCoprime`, `#1506` scope item 2 —
so what is left of the gate is the Wronskian identity alone.  The unconditional forms of
`isCoprime_preΨ_preΩ` and `card_torsion_eq_sq_of_wronskian_of_pair` live there; the hypothesised
forms below are kept because they are what states, in one signature, what each half costs.

⚠️ The hypothesis gap between the two is real and is worth reading off the signatures: separability
of `preΨₙ` is a statement about one polynomial over any field, while turning it into a point count
needs the curve to be elliptic and the field to be closed.  The Wronskian identity is asked for
only at the single index `n`, not at every index.

## What is *not* here

* **No proof of either input.**  `#1506` scope item 1; item 2 is discharged downstream in
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaPairCoprime`, which imports this file.  ⚠️ Both inputs are now proved
  downstream — item 1 by `WeierstrassCurve.hasWronskianId` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaChordSum`)
  — so the hypotheses below are dischargeable, and none of them is proved *here*, which is what this
  bullet is about.
* **Nothing at even `n`.**  `card_torsion_eq_sq_iff_separable_preΨ` is odd-`n` only, and the
  division by `preΨₙ` above uses `ΨSqₙ = preΨₙ²`, which is the odd branch.
* **Nothing about `#1184`'s arbitrary-ring coprimality**, `#403`/`#405`, or the function field.
  ⚠️ In particular this is **not** the fibre route: `card_fibre_comapProjPointN_projPointOfPoint`
  (`EllipticCurves.FunctionField.MulByNFibre`) computes its `n²` *from* `card_torsion_eq_sq_of_
  smooth`, so it cannot supply this count without circularity.
* **No change to `PrimaryTower`'s gate list or to `#293`.**  This file only renames what is owed.
  ⚠️ This bullet used to continue *"Those record `#E[p] = p²` as open, and it is open"*, which is
  false at odd `p`: `card_torsion_eq_sq_of_odd` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaChordSum`) proves it,
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.PrimaryTowerOdd` discharges the gate list with it, and `#293`'s odd half
  goes with it.  The bullet's own claim — that nothing changes *in this file* — still holds.

/-- **`preΩₙ` does not vanish at a root of `preΨₙ`** — scope item 2 of `#1506`, reduced to `hpair`.

Everything except `hpair` is merged.  ⚠️ Read the proof as a budget: `Φₙ(x) ≠ 0` is
`eval_Φ_ne_zero_of_eval_ΨSq_eq_zero` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionOrder`, PR #569) and
`Ψ₂Sq(x) ≠ 0` is `eval_Ψ₂Sq_ne_zero_of_eval_preΨ_eq_zero` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OddTorsionCount`,
PR #574); together with `ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub_eq_neg_Φ_mul_ΨSq` at `q = 1` and `q = 2` they give
`ψ_{n−1}(x, y) ≠ 0` and `ψ_{n+2}(x, y) ≠ 0`.  `hpair` then collapses `Ωₙ` to `2·ψ_{n+2}·ψ_{n−1}²`,
and `WeierstrassCurve.Ω_factor` divides out the `ψ₂²`.

⚠️ `hpair` is the whole content of this statement.  It says the two summands of `Ωₙ` are
negatives of one another at a point where `ψₙ` vanishes; equivalently, since their product is
`−Φₙ³·Ψ₂Sq` by the two instances above, that `(ψ_{n+2}·ψ_{n−1}²)² = Φₙ³·Ψ₂Sq`.  ⚠️ It is **not** a
consequence of `ψ_add_mul_ψ_sub` alone: that relation determines `ψ_{n+k}·ψ_{n−k}` for each `k` and
says nothing relating different `k`, which is exactly what `hpair` needs.  It **is** a consequence
of the `k`-general `ψ_shift_symm_of_ψ_eq_zero`, and is proved from it in
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.OmegaPairCoprime` (`ψ_pair_of_equation`). -/

/-! ## ⚠️ Non-vacuity of the Wronskian hypothesis, and a measurement of what proving it costs

`hid` is an implication's hypothesis, so it is worth knowing that it is **not** vacuous.  It is
proved outright below at `n = 1` and `n = 2`, by expanding both sides.

⚠️ **And the measurement, which is the more useful half.**  The same script at `n = 3` — the first
index where `Φₙ` and `ΨSqₙ` are not small — **exceeds `maxRecDepth` inside the `C`-normalisation,
before `ring` is even reached**, in 20 s.  Raising `maxRecDepth` is a `set_option` and this
development does not use them.  So `#1506` scope item 1 cannot be done index by index and cannot be
done by expansion: it needs the `normEDS` induction or the universal-curve route, and a worker who
starts by trying `n = 5` directly will only rediscover this.
