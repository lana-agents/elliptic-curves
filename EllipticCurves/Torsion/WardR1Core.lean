# Ward's theorem, the `r = 1` slice: the elliptic addition formula for `normEDS`

Building on the infrastructure of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.WardR1` (symmetries of the relator, the
`q ∈ {0, 1}` base slices, and the universal-ring nonvanishing framework), this file develops the
`r = 1` slice of the elliptic-net relation for the canonical normalised elliptic divisibility
sequence `normEDS b c d` over an arbitrary `CommRing R`:

```
IsEllipticNet.rel (normEDS b c d) p q 1 0 = 0    for all p q : ℤ,
```

which, using `normEDS 1 = 1`, is exactly **Ward's elliptic addition formula** (Ward 1948):

```
W (p + q) * W (p - q) = W (p + 1) * W (p - 1) * W q ^ 2 - W (q + 1) * W (q - 1) * W p ^ 2 .
```

This is (the `r = 1` slice of) the standing Mathlib `TODO` "prove that `normEDS` satisfies
`IsEllipticDvdSequence`" in `Mathlib/NumberTheory/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean`.

## What this file delivers

The full addition formula reduces, over the universal coefficient ring `UnivEDS = ℤ[X₀, X₁, X₂]`,
to a **single research-grade core** — the gap `≥ 3` case, isolated here as the hypothesis
`WardGapCore`. Everything else is discharged unconditionally and sorry-free:

* the ℤ → ℕ sign reduction (`IsEllipticNet.rel_one_neg_left`/`_right`) and the swap antisymmetry
  extending `b ≤ a` to all pairs (`IsEllipticNet.rel_one_swap`);
* the **diagonal** `p = q` slice, `normEDS_rel_one_univ_diag` / `normEDS_rel_one_diag` /
  `Affine.ψ_rel_one_diag` — proved from the swap antisymmetry and characteristic `0` of the
  universal ring, then transferred to every `CommRing R` (so it is **unconditional**);
* the bases `q ∈ {0, 1}` (`normEDS_rel_one_zero`/`_one`) and the two doubling bands
  `|p − q| ∈ {1, 2}` (the two-term recurrences `normEDS_rel_odd`/`normEDS_rel_even`);
* the **complete** `UnivEDS → R` transfer (`aeval Xᵢ ↦ b, c, d` composed with `map_rel` and
  `map_normEDS`) and the specialisation to the division polynomials `W.ψ` and their point-values.

Consequently the whole `r = 1` slice is available **conditionally on the single fact `WardGapCore`**
(`normEDS_rel_one_of_gapCore`, `Affine.ψ_rel_one_of_gapCore`, `..._evalEval_of_gapCore`): the
instant `WardGapCore` is discharged, the full public API for the torsion tree (rungs #251, #255)
follows by feeding it in.

## ⚠️ The `r = 1` slice is not a slice: it **is** `IsEllipticSequence`

Mathlib defines `IsEllipticSequence W` as `∀ p q r, rel W p q r 0 = 0`, and it is natural to read
the `r = 1` case as a first step towards it. It is not a step — it is the whole thing. For any odd
`W` over any `CommRing`, `IsEllipticNet.one_sq_mul_rel_zero`
(`EllipticCurves.Torsion.WardR1`) gives

```
W 1 ^ 2 * rel W p q r 0
  = W r ^ 2 * rel W p q 1 0 + W p ^ 2 * rel W q r 1 0 + W q ^ 2 * rel W r p 1 0,
```

a formal identity closed by `ring` after one oddness rewrite, with no recurrence and no `W 1 = 1`.
So `normEDS_isEllipticSequence_of_gapCore` below is conditional on **exactly** `WardGapCore` and on
nothing else, and there is no further induction between the two.

⚠️ **This proves nothing about `WardGapCore` and does not weaken it.** It says how much the `r = 1`
slice already buys, not that the slice is any closer. ⚠️ And it is **one of the two conjuncts** of
Mathlib's `IsEllipticDvdSequence`: the other, `IsDvdSequence (normEDS b c d)`, is proved neither in
Mathlib nor here, so discharging `WardGapCore` would close half of that `TODO`.

## Why the core is isolated rather than proved

`WardGapCore` cannot be closed by an elementary induction. Writing `h(p, q)` for the relator, the
bands `|p − q| = 1, 2, 3` all admit uniform bounded-degree `linear_combination` certificates in the
two-term recurrences, but it was verified — by an exact multivariate polynomial-certificate search
(each `W(n)` an independent symbol) and against the literature (Ward 1948; Silverman AEC III,
Exercise 3.7; Stange, *Elliptic nets and elliptic curves*; van der Poorten–Swart) — that the bands
`|p − q| = 5, 7, …` admit **no** bounded-degree certificate even allowing every smaller relator plus
both doublings: the minimum certificate degree grows with the gap. A complete proof needs the
sigma-function four-term theta identity or the van der Poorten–Swart continued-fraction (Somos)
machinery — a research-level formalisation, and precisely the open Mathlib `IsEllipticDvdSequence`
TODO. `WardGapCore` names exactly that remaining content.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.WardGapCore` : the isolated gap `≥ 3` core, over the universal ring `UnivEDS`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_rel_one_univ_of_gapCore` : Ward's addition formula over `UnivEDS`,
  conditional on `WardGapCore`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_rel_one_of_gapCore` : the addition formula over an arbitrary `CommRing`,
  conditional on `WardGapCore`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_rel_one_of_gapCore` : its specialisation to the division polynomials.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_rel_one_diag` / `Affine.ψ_rel_one_diag` : the diagonal `p = q` slice,
  **unconditional**.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_isEllipticSequence_of_gapCore`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_isEllipticSequence_of_gapCore` and its `evalEval` companion :
  `IsEllipticSequence` at *every* `r`, conditional on the same `WardGapCore`.

/-! ### The isolated gap `≥ 3` core -/

/-- **The gap `≥ 3` core of Ward's `r = 1` addition formula**, stated over the universal coefficient
ring `UnivEDS = ℤ[X₀, X₁, X₂]`: for natural indices `b ≥ 2` and `a ≥ b + 3`,
`rel (normEDS X₀ X₁ X₂) a b 1 0 = 0`.

This single fact is the entire remaining content of Ward's `r = 1` slice (the standing Mathlib
`IsEllipticDvdSequence` TODO); see the module documentation for why it resists an elementary
induction. All of `normEDS_rel_one_of_gapCore` and its corollaries are unconditional apart from a
hypothesis of this form. -/
