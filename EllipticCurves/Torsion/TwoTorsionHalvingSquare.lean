# The halving quartic is a square exactly at a `2`-torsion point

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.HalvingExtension` builds a separable extension over which a **`2`-torsion**
point of `W` acquires a halving, and the identity it runs on is

```
Φ₂ - C x₀ · Ψ₂Sq = (halvingX x₀)²      (`Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq`)
```

under the hypothesis `hx₀ : W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ = 0`.  That file's `## What is *not* here` says of the
other case, in terms:

> **A halving of a point that is not `2`-torsion.**  `hx₀ : W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ = 0` is a hypothesis of
> the square identity and of everything downstream of it.

and adds that **nothing below in that file** states the case, *"in either direction"*.  **This file
states one of those two directions**, and that bullet points here for it.  The hypothesis is not
merely sufficient: it is **necessary**, and necessary in the strongest available sense — not only is
the quartic then not *that* square, it is not the square of **any** polynomial.

## The mechanism: the defect is linear and its `X`-coefficient is `2·Ψ₂Sq(x₀)`

The identity above is the vanishing of a defect that exists with no hypothesis at all.  Writing
`K := 4x₀² + b₂x₀ + b₄`, so that `halvingX x₀ = X² - 2x₀·X - K/2`, expansion gives

```
(halvingX x₀)² - (Φ₂ - C x₀ · Ψ₂Sq) = C (2·Ψ₂Sq(x₀))·X + C ((K/2)² + b₈ + b₆x₀)
```

for **every** `x₀`, away from characteristic `2` (`halvingX_sq_sub_Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq`).  ⚠️ **The
`X²` coefficient cancels identically and the `X` coefficient is `Ψ₂Sq` read at `x₀`, doubled** — so
one coefficient of one expansion carries the whole converse, and `b_relation` is not needed for it.
Only the *constant* coefficient needs `b_relation`, and it is the landed identity that supplies its
vanishing rather than the other way round (`sq_halvingX_const_of_root`).

## Why `IsSquare` and not just `halvingX`

A converse phrased at `halvingX` would say only that *this* quadratic fails.  The sharper statement
is that no quadratic succeeds, and it costs a three-line degree argument rather than a coefficient
comparison.  Write `H := halvingX x₀` and `D` for the defect.  If `Φ₂ - C x₀ · Ψ₂Sq = Q · Q` then
`(H - Q)(H + Q) = D`, whose degree is at most `1`; but `(H - Q) + (H + Q) = C 2 · H` has degree
exactly `2`, so one factor has degree at least `2`, and a product of two nonzero polynomials over a
field has the degree of the sum.  Hence a factor vanishes, hence `D = 0`.  ⚠️ **Nothing in that
argument looks at `Q`'s degree or leading coefficient**, which is what keeps it short.

## Main statements

**The hypotheses the bullets omit**, keyed on the binders and not on the names.  **All eight**
statements listed below bind `(2 : F) ≠ 0`, and **three** bind one thing more:
`not_isSquare_Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq` binds `W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ ≠ 0`, `sq_halvingX_const_of_root` binds
`W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x₀ = 0`, and `eval_Ψ₂Sq_eq_zero_of_isSquare` binds
`IsSquare (W.Φ 2 - C x₀ * W.Ψ₂Sq)`.  The remaining **five** bind nothing beyond `(2 : F) ≠ 0`.
`x₀` is **explicit** in those five and **implicit** in the three, which is the same split read
from the other side.  ⚠️ **No statement below binds a typeclass hypothesis beyond `[Field F]`** —
no `[W.IsElliptic]`, no `[DecidableEq F]`, no `[IsAlgClosed F]` — and **none binds
`W.Ψ₂Sq.Separable`**.  ⚠️ `W` is a bare `WeierstrassCurve.Affine F` throughout and is never assumed
elliptic, so these statements reach singular Weierstrass curves as well; that is inherited from
`Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq`, which needs no ellipticity either.

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.halvingX_sq_sub_Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq`: the defect identity, with no
  hypothesis on `x₀`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.degree_halvingX_sq_sub_le` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.coeff_one_halvingX_sq_sub`: the two readings of the defect the converse
  uses — its degree is at most `1`, and its `X`-coefficient is `2·Ψ₂Sq(x₀)`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.eval_Ψ₂Sq_eq_zero_of_isSquare`: **the converse** — if the quartic is a
  square in `F[X]` then `x₀` is a root of `Ψ₂Sq`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.isSquare_Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_iff` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq_iff`: the two `iff`s, the second
  being the landed identity's own statement turned into a characterisation.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.not_isSquare_Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq`: the negative form, which is the one
  a reader of `HalvingExtension`'s bullet is looking for.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.sq_halvingX_const_of_root`: the constant coefficient of the defect,
  read at a root — a `b`-invariant identity that falls out of the landed theorem.

## What is *not* here

* ⚠️ **Separability of the quartic for `x₀` outside the `2`-torsion.**  The same bullet of
  `HalvingExtension` records that the quartic is generically separable there, italicising the word.
  Nothing below says that: *not a square* is strictly weaker than *separable* — a quartic can fail
  to be a square and still have a repeated root — and the separable statement needs a quartic
  discriminant, which the section headed
  *"The quartic is not separable, and that is why this is not `#1985` again"* records as
  unavailable at this index.  **This file settles the square question and leaves the separability
  question open**, so the bullet's *"in either direction"* is narrowed in one direction only.
* **Any statement about halvings.**  No point of `W` appears below, and nothing here is said about
  `exists_nsmul_two_eq_some_of_root` or about any extension of `F`.  The bridge from *"the quartic
  is not a square"* to *"the halving costs a quartic extension rather than a quadratic one"* is a
  degree argument this file does not make.
* **Characteristic `2`.**  `halvingX` divides by `2` and every statement below carries
  `(2 : F) ≠ 0`; nothing here decides anything at characteristic `2`, in either direction.
* **`n = 3`, and `n` in general.**  Every statement below is at `n = 2`: `Φ 2`, `Ψ₂Sq` and one
  quadratic.  Nothing is stated at a general index.

## Non-vacuity

`EllipticCurves.Fixture.y2EqX3SubX` at `R = ℚ` — the curve `y² = x³ - x`, whose `2`-torsion cubic
is `4X³ - 4X` with roots `0`, `1`, `-1` — certifies **both** verdicts of the `iff` on one curve:
`x₀ = 0` is a root and the quartic is a square there, and `x₀ = 2` is not a root and the quartic is
a square for no polynomial.  ⚠️ **Both halves are needed**: a curve exhibiting only the negative
verdict would leave `isSquare_Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_iff` green with its left side never satisfied.

/-! ## The converse -/

/-- **If the halving quartic is a square in `F[X]`, the point is `2`-torsion.**

The converse of `Φ_two_sub_C_mul_Ψ₂Sq_eq_halvingX_sq`, and it quantifies over *every* polynomial
rather than over the one that file builds.  ⚠️ **The proof never looks at `Q`'s degree or leading
coefficient.**  With `H := halvingX x₀` and `D` the defect, `(H - Q)(H + Q) = D` has degree at most
`1` while `(H - Q) + (H + Q) = C 2 · H` has degree exactly `2`, so one summand has degree at least
`2`; over a field the degree of a product of nonzero factors is the sum of their degrees, so a
factor must vanish and then `D = 0`.  Reading `D`'s `X`-coefficient finishes it. -/
