# The structure of the `3`-torsion subgroup `E[3]`

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeTorsion` describes `E[3]` as the points lying above the roots of the
`3`-division polynomial `Ψ₃` and deduces `Finite (W.torsion 3)` and `#E[3] ≤ 9` over an arbitrary
field of characteristic `≠ 3`.  This file sharpens that bound to an equality and identifies the
group: for an elliptic curve `W : Affine F` over a field `F` of characteristic `≠ 2` and `≠ 3`
**over which `Ψ₃` splits and `Ψ₂Sq` takes a square value at each root of `Ψ₃`**,

```
Nat.card (W.torsion 3) = 9        and        W.torsion 3 ≃+ ZMod 3 × ZMod 3.
```

⚠️ **Those two conditions are exactly what the algebraic closure was being used for, and an
algebraically closed field is the special case in which both are free.**  The `_of_splits` forms
below carry them and the closed forms are their corollaries, which is the shape
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsion` already has at `n = 2`.

⚠️ **The two conditions are not one condition, and that is the difference from `n = 2`.**  At
`n = 2` a torsion point *is* its `x`-coordinate, so `card_torsion_two_of_splits` needs the
`2`-division cubic to split and nothing more.  At `n = 3` the description of `E[3]`
(`torsionThreeEquiv`) is a **sigma** over the roots of `Ψ₃` rather than an `Option` of them:
splitting `Ψ₃` fixes the base and says nothing about the fibres, each of which is a quadratic in
`y` of discriminant `Ψ₂Sq.eval x`.  So the second condition is about a **different polynomial** and
no amount of splitting `Ψ₃` supplies it.

This is the `n = 3` instance of the structure theorem `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²`
(Silverman, *AEC*, III.6, Corollary 6.4), the analogue for `n = 3` of the `n = 2` computation in
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsion`.  Like those files it is **independent of the elliptic-net
recurrence and of the multiplication-by-`n` coordinate formula `x(nP) = Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)`**.

## The two missing ingredients

Over an arbitrary field the description of `E[3]` in `ThreeTorsion` leaves two gaps, both closed
here.

**1. Each root of `Ψ₃` really does carry two `3`-torsion points.**  The `⇐` direction of
`mem_torsion_three_some_iff` carries the side condition `y ≠ W.negY x y`.  It is automatic:
writing `d = 2y + a₁x + a₃` and `n = 3x² + 2a₂x + a₄ - a₁y` for the values of `∂W/∂Y` and `-∂W/∂X`,
the doubling defect `Ψ₃_eval_eq_neg` says `n² + a₁nd - (a₂ + 3x)d² = -Ψ₃(x)`, so at a root of `Ψ₃`
with `d = 0` one gets `n = 0` too, and both partial derivatives of the Weierstrass polynomial would
vanish (`Y_ne_negY_of_Ψ₃_eval_eq_zero`).  Hence `Ψ₂Sq.eval x = d² ≠ 0`, the Weierstrass equation is
a *separable* quadratic in `y`, and it has exactly two roots as soon as that discriminant is a
**square** (`card_setOf_equation_eq_two_of_isSquare`) — free over an algebraically closed field
(`card_setOf_equation_eq_two`), and the second of this file's two conditions otherwise.  ⚠️ This is
the *only* place either statement below uses a square root, and it is the half with no `n = 2`
counterpart.

**2. `Ψ₃` is separable.**  Its formal derivative is `3Ψ₂Sq` (`derivative_Ψ₃`), so a repeated root
of `Ψ₃` would be a common root of `Ψ₃` and `Ψ₂Sq` — excluded by the previous paragraph, ⚠️ and
excluded there with **no algebraic closure at all** (`Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃`), since the
point above `x` that the argument consumes is `twoTorsionY` itself.  As `Ψ₃` has degree `4` away
from characteristic `3`, it has exactly four distinct roots as soon as it **splits**
(`card_roots_Ψ₃_of_splits`), hence over an algebraically closed field (`card_roots_Ψ₃`).  No
quartic discriminant is needed.

Combining, `E[3]` is the point at infinity together with two points above each of four roots, so
`#E[3] = 1 + 2 · 4 = 9`, and the group structure follows from the classification core
`AddCommGroup.equiv_zmod_sq_of_card_sq` of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.AbelianStructure`.  The rank
hypothesis of that core at the prime `2` is *not* automatic here (unlike in the `n = 2` case): it
uses instead that an element killed by both `2` and `3` is killed by `1`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsionThreeOfPair`: the `3`-torsion point attached to a root of `Ψ₃`
  together with a `y`-coordinate above it, with `none` sent to the point at infinity.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsionThreeEquiv`: the bijection
  `E[3] ≃ Option ((x : {x // W.Ψ₃.eval x = 0}) × {y // W.Equation x y})`.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Y_ne_negY_of_Ψ₃_eval_eq_zero`: above a root of `Ψ₃` no point of `W` is
  fixed by negation.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.derivative_Ψ₃`: `Ψ₃' = 3 · Ψ₂Sq`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_equation_of_isSquare`: a point of `W` lies above `x` as soon as
  `Ψ₂Sq.eval x` is a square, over any field of characteristic `≠ 2`;
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.exists_equation` is the algebraically closed case.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_setOf_equation_eq_two_of_isSquare`: exactly two points lie above a
  value of `x` at which `Ψ₂Sq` is a nonzero square, over any field of characteristic `≠ 2`;
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_setOf_equation_eq_two` is the algebraically closed case.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃`: a root of `Ψ₃` is not a root of `Ψ₂Sq`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_roots_Ψ₃_of_splits`: `Ψ₃` has exactly four roots over any field of
  characteristic `≠ 2, 3` over which it splits; `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_roots_Ψ₃` is the
  algebraically closed case.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_three_of_splits`: `#E[3] = 9` under the two conditions;
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_three` is the algebraically closed case.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionThree_addEquiv_of_splits`: `E[3] ≃+ ZMod 3 × ZMod 3`
  under the same two; `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionThree_addEquiv` is the algebraically
  closed case.

**The hypotheses the bullets omit.**  ⚠️ `Y_ne_negY_of_Ψ₃_eval_eq_zero` takes **neither**
`[W.IsElliptic]` nor a characteristic condition: what it takes is the point-level hypothesis
`(h : W.Nonsingular x y)`, and the nonsingularity of a point *above* `x` is what stands in there
for the discriminant.  `derivative_Ψ₃` takes nothing at all.  Every other bullet takes
`(2 : F) ≠ 0`; `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃`, `card_roots_Ψ₃_of_splits`, `card_roots_Ψ₃` and the
four statements about `W.torsion 3` take `[W.IsElliptic]` as well — the last four from
`section Count`'s `variable` line rather than from their own signatures; from
`card_roots_Ψ₃_of_splits` on there is additionally `(3 : F) ≠ 0`, and the four statements about
`W.torsion 3` take `[DecidableEq F]`.  The two conditions written out are
`hsplits : W.Ψ₃.Splits` and `hsq : ∀ x, W.Ψ₃.eval x = 0 → IsSquare (W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x)`.

## What is *not* here

* ⚠️ **The `3`-division field.**  Nothing below constructs a field satisfying the two conditions,
  and — unlike at `n = 2` — no single polynomial's splitting field does: the second condition is
  about `Ψ₂Sq` at the roots of `Ψ₃`, so the field is `Ψ₃`'s splitting field followed by a tower of
  quadratics.  That is a strictly larger job than `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionSplittingField`
  was, and this file states no `IsGalois`, no `IsSplittingField` and no normal closure.  What is
  delivered here is the layer such a construction would consume, exactly as
  `card_torsion_two_of_splits` is the layer `TwoTorsionSplittingField` consumes.  ⚠️ **Partial
  rather than false, so the words stay and this pointer is added**: of the four clauses above, the
  two that carry a scope carry it to this file in their own words — *"Nothing below"* and
  *"this file"* — and the other two are about the mathematics and not about the tree; all four are
  still true.  But the heading they sit under is read tree-wide (`#1982`), and the construction is
  no longer absent from the tree.  It is `EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeDivisionField`, which builds
  exactly the two-step tower described above — `threeDivisionField`, `Ψ₃`'s splitting field
  followed by the quadratic tower — and discharges both conditions at it, as
  `card_torsion_three_threeDivisionField` and `nonempty_torsionThree_addEquiv_threeDivisionField`,
  with `isSeparable_threeDivisionField` beside them and `isGalois_threeDivisionGaloisField` one
  construction further on — ⚠️ `isGalois_tower_top` is `IsGalois L₁ L₂` and says nothing about
  `L₂ / F`, which is the whole reason `threeDivisionGaloisField` exists.  ⚠️ **The three
  negatives are answered at two different commits and not at one, and in
  `ThreeDivisionField.lean` rather than here or tree-wide**: that file carried `IsGalois` and
  `IsSplittingField` from `44272f7` (`#2172`), which created it with **0** occurrences of
  `normalClosure` in it, and `normalClosure` only from `231becd` (`#2189`), as
  `threeDivisionGaloisField`.  ⚠️ **Tree-wide all three predate `44272f7`** — at its parent
  `EllipticCurves/*.lean` reads `IsGalois` **202** in 32 files, `IsSplittingField` **20** in 5 and
  `normalClosure` **13** in 1 — so those two shas date the file and not the tree.  ⚠️ **And
  *"the layer such a construction would consume"* is what this file turned out to be, checkably
  rather than rhetorically**: that file imports this one directly, and its proofs cite
  `card_torsion_three_of_splits`, `nonempty_torsionThree_addEquiv_of_splits`,
  `card_roots_Ψ₃_of_splits` and `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃`.  `### Reach clauses`'
  *"false or merely partial"* test therefore returns **partial**, so `### Retired claims` does not
  bind and nothing here is quoted as retired.
* ⚠️ **A certificate over a field that is not algebraically closed**, and the reason is worth
  recording rather than leaving as an omission: the two conditions together say `E[3] ⊆ E(F)`, and
  the Weil pairing `e₃` is surjective and Galois-equivariant, so they **force `μ₃ ⊆ F`**.  Over `ℚ`
  they are therefore jointly unsatisfiable for every elliptic curve, and no rational fixture can
  certify the statements below the way `y2EqX3Add5X2Add4X` certifies their `n = 2` analogues.  ⚠️
  That argument is classical and is **not** formalised here; no statement below depends on it.  A
  certificate wants a base containing a primitive cube root of unity — `y² = x³ + 2` over `ZMod 7`
  satisfies both conditions, with `Ψ₃` splitting at `{0, 3, 5, 6}` and `Ψ₂Sq` taking the values
  `{1, 4, 4, 4}` there.  ⚠️ That base is not available in this module's import closure
  (`Field (ZMod 7)` is not synthesisable from it), and pulling a finite-field import into a module
  eight files import directly is the trade `EllipticCurves.Fixtures` rules against in terms, so the
  certificate belongs in its own module and is filed rather than shipped here.
* **`n = 2`.**  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsion` and
  `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsionSplittingField` are untouched, and nothing below is stated at a
  general `n`.

over any field of characteristic `≠ 2`: the two square roots of `Ψ₂Sq.eval x` give the two

nonzero.

⚠️ **The two hypotheses are independent and both are needed**: `hsq` produces the roots and `hx`
keeps them apart.  Over an algebraically closed field `hsq` is free — that is
`card_setOf_equation_eq_two` below — and over a field that is not closed it is the *second* of the
two conditions an `#E[3] = 9` count has to carry, which is why `card_torsion_three_of_splits` takes
more than a splitting hypothesis.

⚠️ The hypothesis is `IsSquare`, not `∃ s, s ^ 2 = _`, matching `exists_equation_of_isSquare`

/-- **`#E[3] = 9`** for an elliptic curve over any field of characteristic `≠ 2, 3` over which the
`3`-division quartic **splits** and the `2`-division value is a **square at every root of it**: the
point at infinity together with the two points above each of the four roots.

⚠️ **Two hypotheses, and the second has no `n = 2` counterpart.**  At `n = 2` a torsion point *is*
its `x`-coordinate — `y = negY x y` there — so `EllipticCurves.Torsion.TwoTorsion`'s
`card_torsion_two_of_splits` needs the cubic to split and nothing else.  At `n = 3` the description
of `E[3]` is `torsionThreeEquiv`, a **sigma** over the roots of `Ψ₃` and not an `Option` of them,
and splitting `Ψ₃` fixes only the base of that sigma.  Each fibre is the solution set of a
quadratic in `y` of discriminant `Ψ₂Sq.eval x` (`equation_iff_sq`), so a count needs that
discriminant to be a square — **a condition on a different polynomial, which no amount of splitting
`Ψ₃` supplies**.

⚠️ The other half of `card_setOf_equation_eq_two_of_isSquare`'s pair of hypotheses is free here:
`Ψ₂Sq.eval x ≠ 0` at a root of `Ψ₃` is `Ψ₂Sq_eval_ne_zero_of_root_Ψ₃`, which takes no closure and
no squareness. -/
