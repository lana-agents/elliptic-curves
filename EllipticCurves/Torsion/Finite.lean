# A finiteness engine for point sets with bounded `x`-support

For a Weierstrass curve `W` over a field `F`, the Weierstrass equation `y² + a₁xy + a₃y = x³ + …`
is *quadratic in `y`*, so for each fixed `x` there are at most two points `(x, y)` on the curve:
any two solutions `y₁, y₂` satisfy `y₁ = y₂` or `y₁ = negY x y₂` (Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Y_eq_of_X_eq`). Consequently, **any set of affine points whose
`x`-coordinates lie in a finite set is itself finite**.

Counting the same fibres rather than merely bounding them gives the sharper statement that such a
set has at most `2 * S.ncard + 1` elements: at most two points above each `x ∈ S`, plus the point at
infinity. Since the `x`-coordinates of the nonzero `n`-torsion points are expected to be the
`≤ (n² − 1)/2` roots of `W.preΨ n` for odd `n`, and `2 * (n² − 1)/2 + 1 = n²`, this is exactly the
shape of the sharp bound `#E[n] ≤ n²`.

This is the purely geometric counting infrastructure behind the finiteness of `E[n]` (issue #252,
rung 3 of the `#E[n] ≤ n²` program, parent #246). It is deliberately **independent of the
division-polynomial / elliptic-net recurrence**: it takes the finite `x`-support as a *hypothesis*.
The remaining input — that every nonzero `n`-torsion point has an `x`-coordinate among the roots of
a suitable division polynomial — is supplied by the multiplication-by-`n` characterisation (#251),
which is **closed**: `mem_torsionXSupport_of_mem_torsion` (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.XSupport`) in
general, and unconditionally for `n = 3` by `EllipticCurves.Torsion.ThreeTorsion`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.someY`: a classically chosen solution `y` of the Weierstrass equation
  above `x`, whenever there is one. It labels one of the (at most two) points of the `y`-fibre, so
  that the other is distinguished from it by a single `Bool`.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.setOf_equation_subset_pair`: the `y`-fibre `{y | W.Equation x y}` is
  contained in the two-element set `{y₀, W.negY x y₀}` for any solution `y₀`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.setOf_equation_finite`: the `y`-fibre over a fixed `x` is finite.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finite_of_xCoords`: a set of points whose nonzero members have
  `x`-coordinate in a finite set `S` is finite.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ncard_le_of_xCoords`: the cardinality companion, `A.ncard ≤ 2 * S.ncard
  + 1`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsion_finite_of_xCoords`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finite_torsion_of_xCoords`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_le_of_xCoords`: the specialisations to `E[n]`, the exact
  interface the `#E[n] ≤ n²` counting (#252) consumes; #251 supplies the finite `x`-support and is
  closed (`EllipticCurves.Torsion.XSupport`), so `card_torsion_le_sq` is merged there.

/-- **The refined counting engine.**  Same as `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ncard_le_of_xCoords`, except
that the `x`-support is split into a part `S` counted with two points per fibre and a part `S₀` over
which every point of `A` is *its own negative* — and so is alone in its fibre.  The bound drops from
`2 * (S ∪ S₀).ncard + 1` to `2 * S.ncard + S₀.ncard + 1`.

⚠️ The hypothesis `hone` is stated geometrically, as `y = W.negY x y`, rather than in terms of the
bookkeeping value `W.someY x`: that is the form a consumer has, and the translation between the two
is the `Y_eq_of_X_eq` step inside the proof.
