# The `2`-torsion subgroup `E[2]`

For an elliptic curve `W : Affine F` over a field `F` of characteristic `≠ 2` **over which the
`2`-torsion cubic `Ψ₂Sq` splits**, this file computes the `2`-torsion subgroup completely:

```
Nat.card (W.torsion 2) = 4        and        W.torsion 2 ≃+ ZMod 2 × ZMod 2.
```

An algebraically closed field is the special case in which the splitting hypothesis is free, and
the `_of_splits` forms below are stated first for exactly that reason: the closure was never used
for anything else here (see `card_roots_Ψ₂Sq_of_splits`), and a field such as `ℚ` over which a
*named* curve has split `2`-torsion is enough.  The `Nonvacuity` section at the end certifies both
conclusions over `ℚ`, with no hypothesis at all, on `y² = x(x + 1)(x + 4)`.

This is the `n = 2` instance of the structure theorem `E[n] ≅ (ℤ/nℤ)²`
(Silverman, *AEC*, III.6, Corollary 6.4), and the first actual computation of a torsion group in
this development. Unlike the general case it is **independent of the elliptic-net recurrence and of
the multiplication-by-`n` coordinate formula `x(nP) = Φₙ(x)/ΨSqₙ(x)`**: for `n = 2` everything
reduces to the fact that the Weierstrass equation is quadratic in `y`, together with the
discriminant of a cubic.

## The mechanism

A point `P` is killed by `2` exactly when `P = -P`. For an affine point `P = (x, y)` negation acts
by `y ↦ negY x y = -y - a₁x - a₃`, so

```
2 • P = 0  ↔  2y + a₁x + a₃ = 0  ↔  ψ₂(x, y) = 0.
```

Mathlib's congruence `ψ₂² ≡ Ψ₂Sq (mod W)` — transported to an honest identity at a point of `W` by
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_sq_evalEval` — turns this into the pointwise identity

```
W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x = (2y + a₁x + a₃) ^ 2                for every `(x, y)` on `W`,
```

recorded below as `Ψ₂Sq_eval_eq_sq`. Consequently:

* a nonzero `2`-torsion point has an `x`-coordinate which is a root of the cubic `Ψ₂Sq`;
* conversely, if `(2 : F) ≠ 0` and `x` is a root of `Ψ₂Sq`, then the *unique* candidate
  `y = -(a₁x + a₃)/2` (`twoTorsionY`) already satisfies the Weierstrass equation, because the
  displayed identity forces `4 · W.polynomial.evalEval x y = 0`.

So `E[2]` is the point at infinity together with the roots of `Ψ₂Sq` (`torsionTwoEquiv`). Since
`Ψ₂Sq` is Mathlib's `twoTorsionPolynomial`, a cubic with leading coefficient `4` and discriminant
`16Δ`, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic `≠ 2` it has exactly three distinct
roots, whence `#E[2] = 1 + 3 = 4`.

The group structure then follows from the finite-abelian-group classification core
`AddCommGroup.equiv_zmod_sq_of_card_sq` of `EllipticCurves.Torsion.AbelianStructure`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.twoTorsionY`: the `y`-coordinate `-(a₁x + a₃)/2` of the unique point of
  `W` above `x` that is fixed by negation.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsionTwoOfRoot`: the `2`-torsion point attached to a root of `Ψ₂Sq`,
  with `none` sent to the point at infinity.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.torsionTwoEquiv`: the bijection
  `E[2] ≃ Option {x // W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x = 0}`.

## Main statements

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Ψ₂Sq_eval_eq_sq`: `W.Ψ₂Sq.eval x = (2y + a₁x + a₃)²` at a point of `W`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.mem_torsion_two_some_iff`: `(x, y) ∈ E[2] ↔ 2y + a₁x + a₃ = 0`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_roots_Ψ₂Sq_of_splits`: the cubic `Ψ₂Sq` has exactly three roots
  over any field of characteristic `≠ 2` over which it splits;
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_roots_Ψ₂Sq` is the algebraically closed case, and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_roots_Ψ₂Sq_le` is the inequality `≤ 3`, valid unconditionally.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_two_le`: `#E[2] ≤ 4` over any field of characteristic `≠ 2`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_two_of_splits`: `#E[2] = 4` whenever `Ψ₂Sq` splits;
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_torsion_two` is the algebraically closed case.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionTwo_addEquiv_of_splits`: `E[2] ≃+ ZMod 2 × ZMod 2`
  whenever `Ψ₂Sq` splits; `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.nonempty_torsionTwo_addEquiv` is the
  algebraically closed case.

/-! ### Non-vacuity: the splitting hypothesis on a named curve over `ℚ`

⚠️ The certificate below **must** be over a field that is not algebraically closed, or it certifies
`card_torsion_two` instead of anything this file adds.

`y² = x³ + 5x² + 4x = x(x + 1)(x + 4)` over `ℚ`, i.e. `⟨0, 5, 0, 4, 0⟩`, has `b₂ = 20`, `b₄ = 8`,
`b₆ = 0` and `Δ = -b₂²b₈ - 8b₄³ = 6400 - 4096 = 2304 ≠ 0`, so it is elliptic; its `2`-torsion cubic
is `Ψ₂Sq = 4X³ + 20X² + 16X = 4·X·(X + 1)·(X + 4)`, which splits over `ℚ` by inspection.  So
`#E[2] = 4` and `E[2] ≃+ ZMod 2 × ZMod 2` hold over `ℚ` for this curve with **no hypothesis at
all**, and neither statement mentions an algebraic closure.

⚠️ **This is the block a `ℚ` certificate elsewhere should be able to replace itself by.**  The
alternative route to `#E[2] = 4` on a concrete curve — `card_torsion_two_le` for `≤ 4`, plus an
explicit `Fin 4 → W.torsion 2` and its injectivity for `≥ 4` — is correct but costs a case split
over sixteen pairs and four separate `Nonsingular`/`mem_torsion` obligations.  Here the whole
lower bound is one polynomial identity.

⚠️ The three roots must be **distinct** for the count to be `4`, and nothing in the `Splits`
hypothesis says so: it is the discriminant, i.e. `[W.IsElliptic]`, that rules out a repeated root,
inside `card_roots_Ψ₂Sq_of_splits`.  A singular Weierstrass curve with a split but repeated `Ψ₂Sq`
would have fewer than four `2`-torsion points, and this file would not see it. -/
