# `IsEllipticNet` has no content beyond `IsEllipticSequence`

Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet W` is `∀ p q r s : ℤ, IsEllipticNet.rel W p q r s = 0`, a **four**-index
condition; `IsEllipticSequence W` is its `s = 0` slice, and `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticSequence` is
the only implication `Mathlib` records between them.  This file proves the converse for any `W`
whose values at nonzero indices are regular:

```
IsEllipticNet W  ↔  IsEllipticSequence W          (isEllipticNet_iff_isEllipticSequence)
```

Combined with `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticSequence_iff_rel_one` of
`EllipticCurves.Torsion.WardR1`, which collapses `IsEllipticSequence` onto its own `r = 1`
sub-slice, this gives, for an odd normalised `W` with regular values,

```
IsEllipticNet W  ↔  ∀ p q : ℤ, rel W p q 1 0 = 0   (isEllipticNet_iff_rel_one)
```

— the **whole** four-index elliptic-net condition is Ward's two-parameter addition formula.

## ⚠️ What this means for Ward's theorem, and what it does not

`EllipticCurves.Torsion.WardR1Core` isolates the `r = 1` slice for `normEDS` into the single
hypothesis `WeierstrassCurve.WardGapCore`.  The corollaries below therefore give
`IsEllipticNet (normEDS b c d)` over **every** `CommRing`, conditional on exactly `WardGapCore` and
on nothing further: the `s ≠ 0` layer is not additional content.

⚠️ **Nothing here proves, weakens or bears on `WardGapCore` itself.**  As with
`one_sq_mul_rel_zero`, what is removed is a rung that was never there.

⚠️ **`IsEllipticNet` is still only one of the two conjuncts of Mathlib's `IsEllipticDvdSequence`.**
The other, `IsDvdSequence (normEDS b c d)`, is proved neither in `Mathlib` nor here, so discharging
`WardGapCore` would close half of that `TODO`.

## How the four indices come off

Three ingredients, all of them identities of `rel` over an arbitrary `CommRing` with **no** oddness,
**no** `W 0 = 0` and **no** normalisation:

* `IsEllipticNet.rel_reindex_sum` : `rel W p q r s = rel W (q + r + s) q r (p - q - r)`.  A
  term-by-term reindexing: it sends the fourth index to `p - q - r`, which is **even** whenever
  `p + q + r` is.
* `IsEllipticNet.rel_reindex_avg` : `rel W p q r s = rel W p (p - r) (p - q) (q + r + s - p)`.  The
  `rel`-coordinate form of Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet.atomRel_avg_sub`; it sends the fourth index to
  `q + r + s - p`, which is **even** whenever `p + q + r + s` is.
* `IsEllipticNet.sub_mul_mul_rel` : `W (s - k) * W k * rel W p q r s` is a `W(·)W(·)`-combination of
  three relators with fourth index `s - 2 * k`, so at `s = 2 * k` it descends onto `s = 0` at the
  cost of the multiplier `W k ^ 2`.

⚠️ The first two are what makes the odd `s` layer collapse, and **neither is available inside a
single parity class**: for `s` odd, one of `p + q + r` and `p + q + r + s` is even, so exactly one
of the two reindexings lands on an even fourth index — and it is not always the same one.  Both are
needed, which is why `Mathlib`'s `atomRel_avg_sub` alone does not settle this.

⚠️ The **regularity hypothesis** `∀ n ≠ 0, IsRegular (W n)` is the price of `sub_mul_mul_rel`'s
multiplier and nothing else; it is used only at `s = 2 * k`, `k ≠ 0`.  It holds for
`normEDS X₀ X₁ X₂` over the integral domain `UnivEDS` by
`WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_univ_ne_zero`, which is why the `normEDS` corollaries below need no
hypothesis of their own.  ⚠️ It is **not** known to be necessary: no counterexample was found, and
none is claimed.

## Main statements

* `IsEllipticNet.rel_reindex_sum`, `IsEllipticNet.rel_reindex_avg` : the two reindexings.
* `IsEllipticNet.sub_mul_mul_rel` : the `s → s - 2 * k` exchange identity.
* `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticNet_of_isEllipticSequence`,
  `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticNet_iff_isEllipticSequence`,
  `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticNet_iff_rel_one` : the collapse.
* `WeierstrassCurve.normEDS_isEllipticNet_of_gapCore`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.ψ_isEllipticNet_of_gapCore` and its `evalEval` companion :
  `IsEllipticNet` for `normEDS` and for the division polynomials, conditional on `WardGapCore`.

/-! ### Two reindexings of the relator -/

/-- **`rel W p q r s = rel W (q + r + s) q r (p - q - r)`**, for every sequence `W : ℤ → R` over
every `CommRing`.

⚠️ A **formal identity**, and in fact a term-by-term one: the three products of `rel` on the right
are those of `rel` on the left, in the order `1, 2, 3`.  No recurrence, no `W 1 = 1`, no oddness.
It is the `rel`-coordinate form of the transformation
`(α, β, γ, δ) ↦ ((α+β+γ+δ)/2, (α+β-γ-δ)/2, (α-β+γ-δ)/2, (α-β-γ+δ)/2)` of the four arguments of
Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet.atomRel`, which permutes the **twelve** half-indices `(x ± y) / 2` that the
six `atom`s are built from, and thereby preserves each of `atomRel`'s three `atom`-products — which
is where the term-by-term matching above comes from.

⚠️ It does **not** permute the six `atom`s themselves; it re-pairs them.  The atoms of
`atomRel W 1 3 5 9` are `W 2 * W (-1)`, `W 7 * W (-2)`, `W 3 * W (-2)`, `W 6 * W (-3)`,
`W 5 * W (-4)`, `W 4 * W (-1)`, and the transformation sends `(1, 3, 5, 9)` to `(9, -5, -3, 1)`,
whose first atom `atom W 9 (-5) = W 2 * W 7` is none of the six.

⚠️ Its use is that it sends the fourth index to `p - q - r`, of the same parity as `p + q + r`, so
it makes the fourth index **even** whenever `p + q + r` is — whatever the parity of `s`. -/
lemma rel_reindex_sum (p q r s : ℤ) : rel W p q r s = rel W (q + r + s) q r (p - q - r) := by
  simp only [rel]
  ring_nf

/-- **`rel W p q r s = rel W p (p - r) (p - q) (q + r + s - p)`**, for every sequence `W : ℤ → R`
over every `CommRing`.

⚠️ A **formal identity**, and — like `rel_reindex_sum` — a term-by-term one, the three products
matching in the order `1, 2, 3`.  No recurrence, no `W 1 = 1`, no oddness.  It is the
`rel`-coordinate form of Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet.atomRel_avg_sub`, and unlike that lemma it needs
no same-parity side condition, because in these coordinates the parity condition is automatic.

⚠️ Its use is that it sends the fourth index to `q + r + s - p`, of the same parity as
`p + q + r + s`, so it makes the fourth index **even** whenever `p + q + r + s` is. -/
lemma rel_reindex_avg (p q r s : ℤ) : rel W p q r s = rel W p (p - r) (p - q) (q + r + s - p) := by
  simp only [rel]
  ring_nf

/-! ### The exchange identity that lowers the fourth index -/

/-- **The fourth index can be lowered by `2 * k`**: for every sequence `W : ℤ → R` over every
`CommRing`,

```
W (s - k) * W k * rel W p q r s
  = W (r + s) * W r * rel W (p + k) (q + k) k (s - 2 * k)
    - W (q + s) * W q * rel W (p + k) (r + k) k (s - 2 * k)
    + W (p + s) * W p * rel W (q + k) (r + k) k (s - 2 * k) .
```

⚠️ A **formal identity**: no recurrence, no `W 1 = 1` and — in contrast with
`IsEllipticNet.one_sq_mul_rel_zero`, whose shape it shares — **no oddness of `W`**.  The right-hand
side expands into nine products of six `W`-values; the three carrying the factor `W (s - k) * W k`
are the left-hand side, and the other six cancel in three pairs, each pair being one monomial with
opposite signs from two different summands.

⚠️ The shift is by `2 * k` and never by an odd amount, which is why the two reindexings above are
needed as well.  At `s = 2 * k` the multiplier is `W k ^ 2` and the right-hand side lives entirely
in the `s = 0` layer. -/
lemma sub_mul_mul_rel (p q r s k : ℤ) :
    W (s - k) * W k * rel W p q r s =
      W (r + s) * W r * rel W (p + k) (q + k) k (s - 2 * k)

/-! ### The collapse -/

/-- **`IsEllipticSequence W` implies `IsEllipticNet W`**, for any `W : ℤ → R` over any `CommRing`
whose values at nonzero indices are regular.

⚠️ Neither oddness nor `W 1 = 1` is used: the `s = 0` layer alone carries the whole four-index
relation.  The two reindexings `rel_reindex_sum` and `rel_reindex_avg` move the fourth index into
`2ℤ`, and `sub_mul_mul_rel` then descends from `2 * k` to `0` at the cost of `W k ^ 2`, which is the
only place the hypothesis `hreg` is spent. -/

/-- **`IsEllipticNet (normEDS X₀ X₁ X₂)` over the universal ring, conditional on `WardGapCore`.**

⚠️ The regularity hypothesis of `IsEllipticNet.isEllipticNet_of_isEllipticSequence` is *not*
available over a general `R` — `normEDS b c d n` may well be a zero divisor there — so the proof
runs over `UnivEDS`, where it is, and specialises along the ℤ-algebra map `X₀ ↦ b, X₁ ↦ c, X₂ ↦ d`
exactly as `normEDS_rel_one_of_gapCore` does for the `r = 1` slice.

Together with `normEDS_isEllipticSequence_of_gapCore` this says that the `s ≠ 0` layer of Mathlib's
elliptic-net relation is **not** additional content for `normEDS`: both layers are `WardGapCore`. -/
